    "Title": "Recognition of Arabic handwritten words using convolutional neural network",
    "Abstract": "A new method for recognizing automatically Arabic handwritten words was presented using convolutional neural network architecture. The proposed method is based on global approaches, which consists of recognizing all the words without segmenting into the characters in order to recognize them separately. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a particular supervised type of neural network based on multilayer principle; our method needs a big dataset of word images to obtain the best result. To optimize our system, a new database was collected from the benchmarking Arabic handwriting database using the pre-processing such as rotation transformation, which is applied on the images of the database to create new images with different features. The convolutional neural network applied on our database that contains 40,320 of Arabic handwritten words (26,880 images for training set and 13,440 for test set). Thus, different configurations on a public benchmark database were evaluated and compared with previous methods. Consequently, it is demonstrated a recognition rate with a success of 96.76%.",

    "Title": "Data Profiling and Machine Learning to Identify Influencers from Social Media Platforms",
    "Abstract": "Because of the numerous applications domains in which social media networks can be used, the huge volume of data and information uploaded by them is gaining significant interest. Publishing allows consumers to express their thoughts on products and services. Some feedbacks could also influence other users on those things. Therefore, extracting and identifying influencers from social media networks, also profiling their product perceptions and preferences, is critical for marketers to use efficient viral marketing and recommendation strategies. Our major goal in this research is to find the best machine learning model for characterizing influencers on social media networks. However, to achieve this objective, our strategy revolves around applying the PageRank algorithm to profile influential nodes throughout the social media network graph. The results of our experiment showed that the correlation is always different when adding a new parameter to machine learning models, also to determine the suitable model for our needs. In any event, the experiment outcomes are critical and significant to profiling influencers from social media platforms.",

    "Title": "A Novel Band Selection Approach for Hyperspectral Image Classification using the Kolmogorov Variational Distance",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel band selection approach based on the Kolmogorov Variational Distance (KoVD) for Hyperspectral image classification. The main reason we are taking interest in KoVD is its unique relation to the classification error. Our previous works on band selection using the Mutual Information (MI), the Divergence Distance (DD), or the Bhattacharyya Distance (BD) inspire this study; thus, we are particularly interested in finding out how KoVD performs against these distances in terms of the numbers of band retained and the classification accuracy. All the distances in this study are modeled with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) using the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) / Robust Expectation-Maximization (REM). The experiments are carried on four benchmark Hy-perspectral images: Kennedy Space Center, Salinas, Botswana, and Indian Pines (92AV3C). The results show that band selection based on the Kolmogorov Variational Distance performs better than BD and DD, meanwhile against MI the results were too close.",

    "Title": "Fastest Moroccan license plate recognition using a lightweight modified YOLOv5 model",
    "Abstract": "Morocco is witnessing an alarming surge in road accidents. Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) technology is vital in enhancing road safety. It enables applications like traffic management, law enforcement, and toll collection by automatically identifying vehicles on the roads. This paper integrated the ShuffleNet V2 architecture into the end-to-end YOLOv5 object detection system. The goal was to develop a model capable of accurately detecting Moroccan license plates with an 87% accuracy rate. The proposed model was able to achieve high processing speeds of 60 frames per second (FPS) while maintaining a compact size of 1.3 megabytes and a limited computational requirement of 0.44 million floating-point operations. Compared to other models used in similar contexts, this model demonstrates superior performance and high compatibility with embedded systems, making it a promising solution for addressing road safety challenges in Morocco.",

    "Title": "Multi-instance Finger Knuckle Print Recognition based on Fusion of Local Features",
    "Abstract": "Personal identity has become an important asset in today's digital world for any individual in society. Biometrics offers itself as a reliable and secure guarantor of our identities, so it has become essential to build efficient and robust recognition systems. In this orientation, we propose a fusion approach, which aims to optimally exploit the dividing block dimensions in the case of local methods to reduce similarities. We will use the compound local binary model (CLBP) for local features extraction, a robust operator descriptor that exploits both the sign and the inclination information of the differences between the center and the neighbor gray values. The reliability of the proposed approach was evaluated on the PolyU Finger Knuckle Print (FKP) database. We presented several experimental results that show the detailed path of our approach, explain the choices made for each step and illustrate the significant improvements compared to other existing recognition systems in the literature. The recognition rate of the proposed global approach is one of the highest among the other methods. Optimal final approach recognition rates vary between 99.70% and 100%.",

    "Title": "Predicting user behavior using data profiling and hidden Markov model",
    "Abstract": "Mental health disorders affect many aspects of patient’s lives, including emotions, cognition, and especially behaviors. E-health technology helps to collect information wealth in a non-invasive manner, which represents a promising opportunity to construct health behavior markers. Combining such user behavior data can provide a more comprehensive and contextual view than questionnaire data. Due to behavioral data, we can train machine learning models to understand the data pattern and also use prediction algorithms to know the next state of a person’s behavior. The remaining challenges for this issue are how to apply mathematical formulations to textual datasets and find metadata that aids to identify the person’s life pattern and also predict the next state of his comportment. The main idea of this work is to use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict user behavior from social media applications by analyzing and detecting states and symbols from the user behavior dataset. To achieve this goal, we need to analyze and detect the states and symbols from the user behavior dataset, then convert the textual data to mathematical and numerical matrices. Finally, apply the HMM model to predict the hidden user behavior states. We tested our program and identified that the log-likelihood was higher and better when the model fits the data. In any case, the results of the study indicated that the program was suitable for the purpose and yielded valuable data.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of data integration is to integrate the multiple sources of heterogeneous data available on the internet, such as text, image, and video. After this stage, the data becomes large. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the data that can be used for the efficient execution of the query. However, we have problems with solving entities, so it is necessary to use different techniques to analyze and verify the data quality in order to obtain good data management. Then, when we have a single database, we call this mechanism deduplication. To solve the problems above, we propose in this article a method to calculate the similarity between the potential duplicate data. This solution is based on graphics technology to narrow the search field for similar features. Then, a composite mechanism is used to locate the most similar records in our database to improve the quality of the data to make good decisions from heterogeneous sources.",

Because this was too complicated to model exhaustively using traditional methods, it was required to develop a suitable representation formalism. As a result, we created MorphoScript, a declarative object-oriented language that allowed us to best describe the entire morphological knowledge that we could identify.

    "Title": "Secure Palmprint Recognition based on Multispectral Sequential Capture",
    "Abstract": "The security of personal identities is a serious challenge in today's digital world, with so many daily transactions requiring secure solutions. The use of biometric characteristics of the person is presented as the reliable solution to solve this problem. Indeed, this solution is effective, but it hides a weak point which lies in the ability to reproduce certain biometric characteristics for fraud. To overcome this weak point, we propose a secure approach for palmprints that relies on the concept of merging multiple features. Indeed, these features will be extracted from multi-spectral images with different spectra, which allow the extraction of information under the skin of the palm for two different spectrums sequentially in two different times (T1, T2) but instantly. The instant fusion of these characteristics will be impossible to replicate. The images used are grayscale. To satisfy a construction of a reliable and secure system, for this kind of patterns (palmprints), we will use the Compound Local Binary Pattern method, since this method adds an additional bit for each P bits coded by LBP corresponding to a neighbor of the local neighborhood, in order to build a robust system. This feature descriptor, it uses both the sign and tilt information of the differences between the central and neighboring gray values. The reliability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on the Casia Multi-Spectral database. The final experimental results show reliable recognition rates and these recognition rates vary between 99% and 100% for the left and right palms",

    "Title": "What Factors Determine the Academic Orientation in Moroccan Higher Education?",
    "Abstract": "Guidance is a dynamic process that takes place throughout our lives based on various interactions with the environment. Academic and professional guidance is the most important step in a young person’s life, enabling them to make decisions about education, training, employment, and helping them to develop a career. This stage presents a problem for many high school and university students who feel disoriented in front of the plethora of courses offered. In this context, several researchers have conducted a series of studies to explain the important axes that influence this guidance process. In this work, we will present an overview of the subject of our exploratory research, “the academic orientation of Moroccan students”. Then we will see the methodology that follows in order to perform a qualitative analysis of interviews using the NVIVO software. Later, we will prove that creating a good orientation will contribute in one way or another to better employability. Then, based on the theory of planned behavior, we will propose a theoretical model of the factors explaining the students’ orientation.",

    "Title": "New unfreezing strategy of transfer learning in satellite imagery for mapping the diversity of slum areas: A case study in Kenitra city—Morocco",
    "Abstract": "The purpose behind this paper research is to localize and detect, for the first time, three types of shantytowns that can exist in both urban and rural areas in Morocco. The reason why we have conducted this study is the absence of diversity slum mapping in the form of dynamic GIS data, which can be a part of national development strategies to tackle the risk of further proliferation of shantytowns. Therefore, we first create a new database integration from five countries whose content contains 1366 high-resolution patches of 224 × 224 pixels divided into five classes: two types of “Urban Slum”, one type of “Rural Slum”, “Formal Buildings”, and non-built-up area. Second, we suggest employing a variety of performance metrics to come up with the best transfer learning-based models for the unfreezing stage. The study reveals that by handling the unfreezing of the front layers, we can produce a reliable new model where one condition is fulfilled, namely, where high-frequency dissimilarities have arisen between the target and the source datasets. Quantitative results of these methodologies show that our dataset and our unfreezing strategy for the mobilenetv2 model are more accurate compared to other competing models. This new model can localize all possible changes in morphology and shape among the three-slum types with state-of-the-art performance that reaches an overall accuracy of 98.17%, a loss of 0.062, and a kappa score of 97.71%. Our dataset and the code will be publicly available at the github1 to share our results.",

    "Title": "E-LEARNING USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO DISTANCE LEARNING FOR ENHANCED DATA GENERATION",
    "Abstract": "The article highlights the increasing development of intelligent systems in the modern world, aimed at simplifying human learning. It highlighted the emergence of e-learning, designed to disseminate knowledge using artificial intelligence as a solution for higher level education. The main goal of e-learning is to deliver high-quality education in an efficient manner, based on sound technological design. Creating e-learning courses is presented as a complex and expensive task, involving many people and skills. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence offer the possibility of automating this process. This article proposes an innovative approach to strengthen data security in the field of e-learning by integrating artificial intelligence (AI). Using advanced data analysis and statistical modeling techniques, we identify potential vulnerabilities and propose proactive measures to mitigate risks. Our method uses AI to monitor suspicious activities in real time and adapt security policies accordingly. By leveraging AI's versatility in anomaly detection and malicious behavior prediction, our approach provides dynamic defense against emerging threats. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-powered e-learning in ensuring data security while optimizing remote learning processes. The authors thus propose the automatic generation of e-learning courses using intelligent systems, claiming that this method would be more effective than traditional course development methods. The study focuses on automatic generation of e-learning courses, followed by evaluation using concept maps. The researchers claim that this approach is not only more effective than traditional methods, but also that the quality of the courses generated is higher. The article highlights the potential of artificial intelligence to transform the way e-learning courses are developed and delivered, providing a more efficient and higher quality solution for online education.",

In view of the random mobility nodes in MANET, TCP becomes more unreliability in case of higher energy consumption and packet loss. In this paper we proposed a new optimization approach to enhance decision making of TCP based on some changes of IEEE 802.11 MAC uses cross layer approach. The aim is to minimize the impact of retransmissions of packet lost and energy consumption in order to analyse and chose the appropriate routing protocol for TCP that can be enhance QoS MANET. Our simulation results based QoS study using NS3 show that, our proposal achieved better performance of TCP in MANETs significantly, and also improved the throughput, energy consumption and facilitates the traffic transmission over routing protocol.",

    "Abstract": "The concept of implementing games or gamification in education is becoming a growing area in the last decade and a blistering topic among researchers, professors and educational systems. Gaming in education aims to simplify and improve the learning process using technology. Nevertheless, accessibility and inclusion of gaming elements in the higher educational systems inside universities are considered yet. Most of the graduated students endure achieving the mandatory eLearning training to succeed in their integration inside companies. For example, engineers must follow some eLearning courses about Security, Ethics, Agility, Phishing Detection, General Data Protection Regulation...etc., which is tedious. Hence, our research seeks to ease and succeed the integration into companies by applying gamification to these eLearning courses to engage and motivate students to master them before graduation. This paper discusses the use of games in education, then presents a literature review about learning theories, game theory and design, game development process and tools. By collecting hundreds of papers from multiple research databases, we conceived a journal classification, a word frequency analysis using cloud visualization. Then a comparative study based on the topic’s occurrences in our corpus. Finally, a comparison of different conceptual models for gamification of e -learning e nvironments. These r esults o ffer an insightful introduction to the application of game elements in educational settings and the implementation of gamification in e-learning courses.",

    "Title": "Bond Graph Model - Intelligent Online Diagnostics for Education",
    "Abstract": "Nowadays, the control of physical systems is the result of many steps, from design to implementation, modelling and analysis, Especially in the field of education and innovation. It is often necessary to know in advance the performance of the system under study and in this case a mathematical model is more than useful. For economic and performance reasons, it is often necessary in certain situations to have a precise representation of physical phenomena, which leads to complex models and the mathematical tools are not always adapted to the models obtained. For several decades, the most exploited representation has probably been the state representation, or an extension of this form for non-linear models. For some time now, the algebraic approach has been used to discover other characteristics of the models, or at least a new interpretation of properties well known to automaticians. However, these techniques are difficult to use for the uninitiated, and the representation by a link graph model allows to reconcile all the theoretical concepts, which are necessary in the different design phases. Some analysis techniques for design are proposed by bond graph modelling for linear models, but can be quite easily generalised for more general models. In this paper, the bond graph tool proves its intelligence in the implementation of monitoring systems, and in particular an intelligent design support. The causal properties of the bond graph allow to analyse the necessary monitoring conditions before and after the design to generate diagnostic algorithms in a generic way. The following approach is illustrated on a DC motor.",

International economic exchanges have experienced battles between large global companies because of the good marketing of their information. This guides us to confirm that the companies that perfectly manage their information related to their activities and know how to take advantage of the data that exist in their field are the companies that can keep an economic continuity. For this reason, the objective of this study is to work on an analysis strategy of websites especially for companies working in the field of tourism. This analysis will enable targeted companies to compete with their peers for informational competition to secure increased and investigated warehouses’ data. This research is based on a multi-axis analysis as well as on a statistical study that collects the opinions of visitors on the used websites as case studies for this research. The main obtained results include the fact that several websites have many weaknesses. This is something that influences their performance. In addition, it was noticed that several websites’ managers think that the performance of their product is based only on the number of visitors per day or the total of pages read in a specific period.

    "Title": "Performance evaluation of forecasting strategies for electricity consumption in buildings",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, three main approaches (univariate, multivariate and multistep) for electricity consumption forecasting have been investigated. In fact, three major algorithms (XGBOOST, LSTM and SARIMA) have been evaluated in each approach with the main aim to figure out which one performs the best in forecasting electricity consumption. The motivation behind this work is to assess the forecasting accuracy and the computational time/complexity for an embedded forecasting and model training at the smart meter level. Moreover, we investigate the deployment of the most efficient model in our platform for an online electricity consumption forecasting. This solution will serve for deploying predictive control solutions for efficient energy management in buildings. As a proof of concept, an already existing public dataset has been used. These data were mainly collected thanks to the usage of already deployed sensors. These provide accurate data related to occupancy (e.g., presence) as well as contextual data (e.g., disaggregated electricity consumption of equipment). Experiments have been conducted and the results showed the effectiveness of these algorithms, used in each approach, for short-term electricity consumption forecasting. This has been proved by performance evaluation and error calculations. The obtained results mainly shed light on the challenging trade-off between embedded forecasting model training and processing for being deployed in smart meters for electricity consumption forecasting.",

    "Title": "DIGITAL SECURITY IN MOROCCAN UNIVERSITIES IN THE ERA OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE",
    "Abstract": "The rapid advancement of information technology has significantly influenced the digital security environment in Moroccan universities, compelling these institutions to reconsider their approaches in response to more complex risks. The growing digitalization of academic data, including student records and research projects, underscores the crucial need of safeguarding these digital assets, which have become indispensable foundations of contemporary academic endeavors. Artificial intelligence (AI) integration is becoming a critical solution to address the increasing security problems. AI provides a range of sophisticated features, such as proactive identification of threats, immediate analysis of behavior, and the capacity to preemptively stop possible assaults before they occur. Nevertheless, the implementation of heightened security measures presents both practical and ethical obstacles. From a logistical standpoint, the successful implementation of AI necessitates the presence of suitable technical infrastructure and a workforce that is adequately educated to fully use this technology. The expenses linked to the implementation of AI-driven solutions, while potentially lucrative in the future, are a significant concern for Moroccan institutions with sometimes constrained financial resources. Simultaneously, the need to evaluate and control ethical hazards linked to the utilization of AI, such as algorithmic prejudice and privacy ramifications, introduces an intricate aspect to this technological shift. at order to provide a background for these difficulties, the essay explores the present state of digital security at Moroccan institutions, highlighting particular risks and weaknesses that already exist. Subsequently, it examines practical implementations of AI in the academic sphere, showcasing how this technology might be used preemptively to enhance safeguards against cyber hazards. The paper emphasizes the need of a strategy tailored to the local environment by addressing the issues unique to Moroccan institutions, such as financial limitations and training requirements. The suggested answers are derived on a comprehensive comprehension of the distinct requirements of each institution, emphasizing practical approaches to surmount these challenges. Ultimately, a pragmatic case study demonstrates the triumphant integration of AI in a Moroccan university, providing tangible instances and valuable insights gained. These pragmatic observations seek to provide guidance to other Moroccan educational institutions in their pursuit of improved digital security, emphasizing the significance of adjustment, prudent allocation of resources, and the incorporation of ethical issues at every stage of the process.",

If WSN were initially flat networks, hierarchical, or cluster-based networks have been introduced in order to achieve a better performance in terms of energy efficiency, topology management, delay minimization, load balancing, routing techniques, etc. As cluster-based algorithms proved to be efficient in terms of energy balancing, security has been of less importance in the field. Data shared by nodes in a WSN can be very sensitive depending on the field of application. Therefore, it is important to ensure security at various levels of WSN. This paper proposes a formal modeling of the energy consumed to secure communications in a cluster-based WSN in general. The concept is implemented using the Proof of Authentication (POAh) paradigm of blockchain and applied to a Multi-hop Clustering Algorithm based on spectral classification. The studied metrics are residual energy in the network, the number of alive nodes, first and last dead node.",

    "Title": "RE-AODV an enhancement of aodv routing protocol for wireless sensor networks",
    "Abstract": "Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) plays a significant role especially when mobility of nodes is introduced. Although, the introduction of the concept of mobility in WSNs has expanded their range of applications but it influences significantly the connectivity of the networks. In a mobile WSN, the topology of the network changes dynamically, roads maintained by some nodes become invalid, because of mobility of nodes. The main restriction of mobile WSN is the energy consumption. Thus, all routing protocols must consider this constraint and require an enhancement to consume less energy. In this paper we are working with Ad-hoc On Demand Distance vector (AODV) as a routing protocol, we are presenting an enhancement of this routing protocol based on residual energy of each node to optimize the energy consumption and maximize the network lifetime. We named the enhanced protocol: RE-AODV for Residual Energy-AODV.",

    "Title": "Band selection by divergence distance based on gaussian mixture model for hyperspectral image classification",
    "Abstract": "In this work, we investigate a new band selection approach by Divergence distance based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for Hyperspectral image classification. The main motivation in modeling the Divergence distance with GMM is due to the fact that GMM is well known to be less sensitive to estimation error problem than non-parametric models and can capture non Gaussian statistics of multivariate data. To estimate the parameters of GMM, the Expectation Maximization (EM) with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and a Robust Expectation Maximization (REM) algorithm are used. This investigation is inspired by our previous work on the Bhattacharyya distance hence we are particularly interested in using the Divergence distance to find out which one gives better results. The performances of the proposed approach are compared to those of the Bhattacharyya distance in terms of global classification accuracy and numbers of retained bands through two Classifiers; Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experiments are carried out on three hyperspectral images, the Indiana Pines (92AV3C), the Botswana and the Kennedy Space Center dataset (KSC).",

    "Abstract": "This article describes an algorithm of classification by similarity of nodes in a MANET (Clustering). To optimize a network performance without influencing others, we must act only on the cluster structure. Any additional calculation clutters more the system. To overcome this limitation, a strong classification method is needed. The purpose of classification algorithms is the search for an optimal partition. This optimum is obtained iteratively refining an initial pattern randomly selected by reallocating objects around mobile centers. In order to partition the nodes into clusters, we used this technique (iterative reallocation) from the well known k-means algorithm. The algorithm conception is based on the k-means method that we improved and adapted to make it suitable for mobile ad hoc networks. The algorithm is implemented on OLSR giving birth to a new routing protocol: OLSRKmeans.",

    "Abstract": "The design of robust routing protocol schemes for MANETs is quite complex, due to the characteristics and structural constraints of this network. A numerous variety of protocol schemes have been proposed in literature. Most of them are based on traditional method of routing, which doesn’t guarantee basic levels of Qos, when the network becomes larger, denser and dynamic. To solve this problem we use one of the most popular methods named clustering. In this work we try to improve the Qos in MANETs. We propose an algorithm of clustering based in the new mobility metric and K-Means method to distribute the nodes into several clusters; it is implemented to standard OLSR protocol giving birth a new protocol named OLSR Kmeans-SDE. The simulations showed that the results obtained by OLSR Kmeans-SDE exceed those obtained by standard OLSR Kmeans and OLSR Kmed+ in terms of, traffic Control, delay and packet delivery ratio.",

    "Title": "Artificial intelligence for assessing the planets' positions as a precursor to earthquake events",
    "Abstract": "Questions about interconnection possibilities between planets’ positions and seismic events on the earth have emerged recently in TV channels, social media, etc. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) are used to predict the number of earthquakes that can occur on Earth, depending on the Earth's position relative to other planets and solar positions. Our new integration dataset contains 9809 observations and nine features firstly from the global earthquake archive, which is an authoritative layer by Esri, and secondly from the accurate data web portal “theskylive.com.”. The results obtained from RFR and ANN prove the partial influence of planets positions on sesimic activity on the earth. In other words, quantitatively through the ANN that gets an accuracy of 68.27 %, MAE of 5.36, MSE of 52.78, RMSE of 7.26, R-Squared of 0.65, and also through the RFR that gets an accuracy of 65.06 %, MAE of 5.60, MSE of 58.21, RMSE of 7.63, R-Squared of 0.67, prove the partial influence on one hand. Qualitatively through the curve of the training phase of the ANN, which is a decreasing and convex function, reinforces the aforementioned proof on the other hand. For these reasons, it can be deduced that there is a possible connection between tectonic stress triggers and the positions of the planets in the solar system. Our dataset was uploaded to the github(https://github.com/mouddentarik/Earthquake01.) as well as the code will be publicly available at the github(https://github.com/mouddentarik/PythonCode_Earthquakes-.) to share our results.",

By analyzing data, we will be able to identify people’s personalities and information that is also important to specific profiles. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach that predicts the next word during writing a sentence based on the user’s personality. To achieve this goal, our approach is illustrated by two points: (1) An approximate extraction of the big five personality model for a specific user from his tweets. (2) Predicting the next word while a user is writing a new tweet depends on his personality using the Markov chain model. On the basis of these two notions, our approach makes writing posts easier by predicting and suggesting next words based on the user’s personality. Experience represents the ease of predicting the next word during the writing of a new post related to individual potential.",

    "Abstract": "In this work a new traffic sign recognition method by integrating color information based on Steerable Pyramid Transform (SPT) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is introduced. The main contribution of this paper is to explore the usefulness of SPT at different color spaces in a traffic sign recognition framework. Each color traffic sign image is described by a subset of band filtered images containing steerable pyramid coefficients which characterize the traffic sign textures. Linear discriminant analysis is used to reduce the data dimensionality to generate relevant features. These reduced features are used as the input to ELM classifier to analytically learn an optimal model. This work can be a stepping stone for further research in this direction. Experiments on German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and Belgium Traffic Sign Classification Benchmark (BTSCB) databases demonstrate that our proposed method color SPT-ELM can serve as an effective and reasonable feature extraction tool, and achieve good and fast recognition accuracy. In addition, comparisons against some state-of-the-art methods prove the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed approach for color traffic sign recognition and it is more adequate for real-time application.",

    "Title": "Breast cancer diagnosis based on curvelet transform and locality sensitive discriminant analysis with reduced feature set",
    "Abstract": "In this work, a simple and novel approach for breast cancer diagnosis is proposed. We present a highly discriminative and simple descriptor to differentiate between malignant and benign mammogram abnormalities. The proposed method introduces the application of digital curvelet transform and explores feature reduction properties of locality sensitive discriminant analysis (LSDA). The mammogram image is mapped to the curvelet space. Nevertheless, The direct use of curvelet coefficients increases the curse of dimensionality problem and therefore a reduction method is required to handle the huge number of features before performing the classification. LSDA can overcome this problem taking in consideration both the discriminant and geometrical structure of the data. Finally, to accomplish the classification task of the reduced feature vectors we use the nearest neighbor classifier. This work can be considered as a stepping stone for additional research in this direction. Extensive experiments on digital database for screening mammography and INbreast database, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, empirical comparisons of the proposed method against curvelet transform in combination with traditional dimensionality reduction tools demonstrate that the suggested method does not only engender a more reduced feature set, but it also outperforms all the compared methods in terms of accuracy.",

    "Title": "Video sensor node energy preservation through dynamic adaptive video encoding parameters’ values selection",
    "Abstract": "Wireless video sensor networks (WVSN) are energy constrained systems where deployed video nodes are capable of capturing the visual scene, performing local processing such as video compression, then routing the results toward the destination. In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the energy consumed by the video sensor node to encode and transmit the video stream under a defined video quality constraint. In the present work, Intra-Only H.264/AVC is considered as video compression scheme. Particularly, we propose to control at run-time both the energies consumed for video encoding and transmitting, in addition to the video encoding distortion. Thus, we begin our study by profiling the evolution of these quantities according to two coding parameters, namely the frame rate (FR) and the quantization parameter (QP). Following an analysis of the obtained measurements, we propose empirical parametric models in line with the observed behaviors, then validate them with different video sequences. Finally, we introduce the Dynamic Adaptive Encoding Parameters’ values Selection (DAEPS) procedure which relies on these models to solve the problem under consideration. Simulations show the advantage of considering such an approach, which is capable, on the one hand, of extending the lifetime of the video sensor node up to 2.3 times, when compared with state-of-the-art approaches, and on the other hand, of complying with the defined end-to-end video quality constraint.",

To support radiologists to detect breast abnormalities earlier and more rapidly, creation of a system to analyze automatically mammograms is important. Several techniques can be used to accomplish this task. This paper presents a new approach for digital mammograms classification based on hybrid feature extraction. After decomposing mammogram images in wavelet basis for global feature extraction, block-based uniform local binary pattern is used to extract local features from the resulting sub-bands. Principal component analysis is employed for dimensionality reduction The Support vector machine is then used to construct a supervised classifier. Comparisons with another artificial intelligence algorithm i.e. KNearest Neighbor were also made using two distance calculation methods, namely Euclidian and City-block. Experimental results on Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) show that the proposed method can classify normal from abnormal mammograms more effectively and has proved also to be better in comparison to other traditional recognition methods.",

For these reasons, the development of a MAC protocol for WMSN able to ensure a high Traffic-QoS level over energy constrained constitutes a real challenge. In this paper, we propose a new generation of MAC protocols for WMSN, based on the IEEE 802.11e standard.

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient joint video encoding and transmission framework for network lifetime extension, under an end-to-end video quality constraint in the Wireless Video Sensor Networks (WVSN). This framework integrates an energy-efficient and adaptive intra-only video encoding scheme based on the H.264/AVC standard, that outputs two service differentiated macroblocks categories, namely the Region Of Interest and the Background. Empirical models describing the physical behavior of the measured energies and distortions, during the video encoding and transmission phases, are derived. These models enable the video source node to dynamically adapt its video encoder’s configuration in order to meet the desired quality, while extending the network lifetime. An energy-efficient and reliable multipath multi-priority routing protocol is proposed to route the encoded streams to the sink, while considering the remaining energy, the congestion level as well as the packet loss rates of the intermediate nodes. Moreover, this protocol interacts with the application layer in order to bypass congestion situations and continuously feed it with current statistics. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed framework does not only extend the video sensor lifetime by 54%, but it also performs significant end-to-end video quality enhancement of 35% in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) measurement.",

    "Title": "A fuzzy-based QoS maximization protocol for WiFi multimedia (IEEE 802.11e) ad hoc networks",
    "Abstract": "The The Quality of Service (QoS) management within a multiple-traffic Wi-Fi MultiMedia (WMM) ad hoc network is a tedious task, since each traffic type requires a well determined QoSlevel. For this reason, the IEEE Working Group has proposed the IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol at the MAC layer of WMM ad hoc networks. However, several studies have shown that EDCA must be further improved for three main reasons. The first reason is the poor performance of EDCA under high traffic conditions due to the high collision rate. The second reason is the need to maximize the traffic performance (delay, throughput, etc.) guaranteed by EDCA, seen the rapid evolution of the applications (multimedia, real time, etc.). The third reason is the need to maximize the energy efficiency of the EDCA, seen its use in battery constrained devices (e.g. Laptop, Smart phone, Tablet computers, etc.). For these three reasons, we propose in this paper a Three-in-One solution MAC protocol called QoS Maximization of EDCA (QM-EDCA), which is an enhanced version of EDCA. Based on the fuzzy logic mathematic theory, QM-EDCA incorporates a dynamic MAC parameters fuzzy logic system, in order to adapt dynamically the Arbitration inter frame Spaces according to the network state and remaining energy. Simulation results show that QM-EDCA outperforms EDCA by reducing significantly the collision rate, and maximizing traffic performance and energy-efficiency. In addition our solution is fully distributed.",

The image is mapped to the curvelet space. However, the curse of dimensionality problem arises when using the curvelet coefficients directly and therefore a reduction method is required. LSDA is used to reduce the data dimensionality to generate relevant features. These reduced features are used as the input to ELM classifier to analytically learn an optimal model. In contrast to traditional methods, the proposed method learns the features by the network itself and can be applied to more general applications. Extensive experiments conducted in two different domains using two benchmark databases, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, empirical comparisons of the proposed method against curvelet transform in conjunction with traditional dimensionality reduction tools show that the suggested method does not only lead to a more reduced feature set, but it also outperforms all the compared methods in terms of accuracy.",

    "Title": "Impact of queue buffer size awareness on single and multi service real-time routing protocols for WSNs",
    "Abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are increasingly used and will certainly be part of our everyday lives. Many routing protocols were designed with respect to WSNs capacities to allow the achievement of numerous applications. One of the not well investigated areas in WSNs is the queue management issue. The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the impact of queue buffer size awareness on the Quality of Service (QoS) of real-time (RT) routing protocols in WSNs. The studied protocols are SPEED and its extension Multipath Multi-speed (MMSPEED). SPEED protocol yields RT routing for only one class of traffic, by maintaining a desired packet's progression speed (PS) across the WSN. On the other hand, MMSPEED protocol extends SPEED by offering multiple types of service to packets according to their class of traffic. The main contribution is that the routing decision is made on neighbors' available queue buffer size at each level in addition to PS metric. Simulations have proved that the two metrics are compatible, the routing decision is efficient in case of single service protocol and multiservice one and improves two QoS domains namely timeliness and reliability.",

    "Title": "Increasing network lifetime in an energy-constrained wireless sensor network",
    "Abstract": "Energy in wireless sensor networks is a scarce resource, therefore an energy-efficient mechanism is required to increase the network lifetime. In this paper, we study the problem of optimal power allocation, taking into account the estimation of the total signal-to-noise ratio at the fusion centre (FC). We consider that nodes transmit their data to the fusion centre over quasistatic Rayleigh fading channels. In order to analyse our approach, we first investigate the orthogonal channel case and then the non-orthogonal one introducing a virtual MISO framework communication scheme. We consider in both cases that the nodes have channel state information. Simulations show that the new algorithm introduced provides a network extension lifetime of more than 80% in comparison with other traditional methods.

The throughput is defined as the number of bits per second correctly received. Trade-offs between the throughput and the operation range are observed, and equations are derived for the optimal choice of the design variables. The transmitter has a fixed amount of maximum power level to send data. Our goal is the Development of a method of adaptation of power transmission which maximizes the throughput of the systems that have multicarrier for OFDM modulation in a downlink transmission.",

    "Abstract": "In a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), nodes are battery powered and then they are energy constrained. Network lifetime is the most important characteristics of performance for these networks. In this paper, we propose routing protocols that take into account the battery residual energy in sensor nodes and the energy required for transmission along the path toward the sink, which allows the distribution of energy load among the whole network nodes. Simulation results show that the network lifetimes increases up to 50% for the first node die and up to 114% for the last node die over comparable schemes like MLER protocol.

    "Title": "A fairly balanced clustering algorithm for routing in wireless sensor networks",
    "Abstract": "Purpose - Routing protocols in wireless sensor networks (WSN) are a crucial challenge for which the goal is maximizing the system lifetime. Since the sensor nodes are with limited capabilities, these routing protocols should be simple, scalable, energy-efficient, and robust to deal with a very large number of nodes, and also self-configurable to node failures and changes of the network topology dynamically. The purpose of this paper is to present a new algorithm for cluster forming in WSN based on the node energy required to transmit to the base station. Design/methodology/approach - Rotation selection of cluster-head considering the remoteness of the nodes to the sink, and the network node residual energy. Findings - The simulation results show that this algorithm allows network stability extension compared to the most known clustering algorithm. Originality/value - Giving a probability to become cluster-head based on the remoteness of the node to the sink. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Title": "An ontological model based on machine learning for predicting breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is mostly a female disease, but it may affect men as well even at a considerably lower percentage. An automated diagnosis system should be built for early detection because manual breast cancer diagnosis takes a long time. Doctors have lately achieved significant advances in the early identification and treatment of breast cancer in order to decrease the rate of mortality caused by the latter. Researchers, on the other hand, are analysing large amounts of complicated medical data by employing a combination of statistical and machine learning methodologies to assist clinicians in predicting breast cancer. Various machine learning approaches, including ontology-based Machine Learning methods, have lately played an essential role in medical science by building an automated system that can identify breast cancer. This study examines and evaluates the most popular machine learning algorithms, besides the ontological model based on Machine Learning. Among the classification methods investigated were Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbours. The dataset utilized has 683 instances and is available for download from the Kaggle website. The findings are assessed using performance measures generated from the confusion matrix, such as F-Measure, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. The ontology model surpassed all machine learning techniques, according to the results.",

To detect these faults, motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has become the most common method in the field due to its simplicity, low computation time, and remote monitoring capability. Unfortunately, this method has a major drawback relating to the frequency signatures of demagnetization and eccentricity faults, which appear in the same frequency locations. To avoid this drawback while retaining the main advantages of the MCSA method, this paper proposes a new approach for discrimination between demagnetization and eccentricity faults in PMSMs. The proposed approach is based on the simultaneous monitoring of the real and imaginary components of the characteristic harmonics of these faults, which are obtained from stator current spectral analysis.

The aim of this study was to review the reported rate of infectious complications in relation to the type and modality of the endourologic procedure.\nMethods\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Two electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) were searched. Out of 243 articles retrieved we included 49 studies after full-text evaluation.\nResults\nRandom-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) were associated with not significantly different odds of getting fever (OR= 1.54, 95% CI: 0.99 to 2.39; p= 0.06) or sepsis (OR= 1.52, 95% CI: 0.37 to 6.20, p= 0.56). The odds of getting fever were not significantly different for mini PCNL compared to standard PCNL (OR= 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.44; p= 0.45) and for tubeless PCNL compared to standard PCNL (OR= 1.34 95% CI: 0.61 to 2.91, p= 0.47). However, the odds for fever after PCNL with suctioning sheath were lower than the corresponding odds for standard PCNL (OR= 0.37, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.70, p= 0.002).

This approach is based on the application of a very selective band-pass filter in the stator current. A judicious calculation of the parameters of this filter makes it possible to extract only the frequency signatures of searched faults. The use of the relevant information on the magnitude and phase angle of the signatures, obtained by filtering, makes it possible to distinguish between both of the studied faults. The simple monitoring of the plotting in terms of polar coordinates of the combined information (magnitude/phase angle) of the signature’s characteristic of these two faults allows for this discernment. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach when it …",

Due to the emergence of a new generation of data services, some of the problems associated with big data have been resolved. In addition, in the haste to address the challenges of big data, NoSQL abandoned several core databases features that make them extremely efficient and functional, for instance the global view, which enables users to access data regardless of how it is logically structured or physically stored in its sources. In this article, we propose a method that allows us to query non-relational databases based on the ontology-based access data (OBDA) framework by delegating SPARQL protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) queries from ontology to the NoSQL database.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, the need of recommender systems has increased to enhance user engagement, provide personalized services, and increase revenue, especially in the online shopping industry where vast amounts of customer data are generated. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used and effective approach for generating appropriate recommendations. However, the current CF approach has limitations in addressing common recommendation problems such as data inaccuracy recommendations, sparsity, scalability, and significant errors in prediction. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid CF method for movie recommendations that combines the incremental singular value decomposition approach with an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach in two phases, online and offline. The ontology-based technique is leveraged to enhance the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. Evaluating our method on a real-world movie recommendation dataset using precision, F1 scores, and mean absolute error (MAE) demonstrates that our system generates accurate predictions while addressing sparsity and scalability issues in recommendation system. Additionally, our method has the advantage of reduced running time.",

    "Abstract": "Diabetes, a chronic illness, has seen an increase in prevalence over the years, posing several health challenges. This study aims to predict diabetes onset using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. We implemented several machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. To enhance model performance, we applied a variety of feature engineering techniques, including SelectKBest, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), Forward Feature Selection, and Backward Feature Elimination. RFECV proved to be the most effective method, leading to the selection of the best feature set. In addition, hyperparameter tuning techniques are used to determine the optimal parameters for the models created. Upon training these models with the optimized parameters, XGBoost outperformed the others with an accuracy of 94%, while Random Forest and CatBoost both achieved 92.5%. These results highlight XGBoost's superior predictive power and the significance of thorough feature engineering and model tuning in diabetes prediction.",

To do this, an extension of the Modified Winding Function Approach (MWFA) is proposed to accurately take into account the air gap asymmetry caused by the Demagnetization Fault (DF) in the PMSM inductances calculation. The calculated inductances are then used in the magnetically coupled electrical circuit model to simulate the PMSM behavior in the different operating modes. Finally, a diagnostic method based on the stator current spectral analysis is used to highlight the PMSM stator current spectral content in the various operating modes (with and without Demagnetization Fault).",

    "Title": "A modified choice function hyper-heuristic with boltzmann function",
    "Abstract": "Hyper-heuristics are a subclass of high-level research methods that function in a low-level heuristic research space. Their aim objective is to improve the level of generality for solving combinatorial optimization problems using two main components: a methodology for the heuristic selection and a move acceptance criterion, to ensure intensification and diversification [1]. Thus, rather than working directly on the problem’s solutions and selecting one of them to proceed to the next step at each stage, hyper-heuristics operates on a low-level heuristic research space. The choice function is one of the hyper-heuristics that have proven their efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems [2–4]. At each iteration, the selection of heuristics is dependent on a score calculated by combining three different measures to guarantee both intensification and diversification for the heuristics choice process. The heuristic with the highest score is therefore chosen to be applied to the problem. Therefore, the key to the success of the choice function is to choose the correct weight parameters of its three measures. In this study, we make a state of the art in hyper-heuristic research and propose a new method that automatically controls these weight parameters based on the Boltzmann function. The results obtained from its application on five problem domains are compared with those of the standard, modified choice function proposed by Drake et al. [2, 3].",

    "Title": "Compressive sensing and paillier cryptosystem based secure data collection in WSN",
    "Abstract": "Due to the technological advancements and smart deployment, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) receive much attention in numerous real-time application fields. The stringent limitations of the battery of sensor devices and dubious wireless medium incur enormous challenges in the secure data collection and routing. Integration of compressive sensing and cryptography mechanism provide an efficient paradigm for reliable and energy efficient data collection over WSNs. With the aim of reducing communication cost and resilience against different WSN security attacks, this paper proposes a paillier cryptosystem and compressive sensing based routing (PC2SR) protocol. To achieve its objective, the proposed PC2SR designs three mechanisms that are paillier cryptosystem based key distribution and management, intra-cluster data gathering, and secure data transmission. Initially, the PC2SR provides paillier security keys to each device for data authentication. Instead of providing a long term security keys among two entities, the lightweight key refreshing mechanism of paillier cryptosystem in PC2SR updates the keys over a specific time interval. Secondly, the design of the Spatio-temporal measurement matrix within the intra-cluster reduces the computation and communication costs considerably. The integration of zero noise factors with all transmitted data assists the BS in detecting and isolating malicious behaviors in the network. Thus, the PC2SR efficiently offers high security in terms of integrity and confidentiality over WSN. We compare PC2SR to existing schemes, CSDA developed in 2017 and CSHEAD in early 2021 which outperform CSDA. The new scheme PC2SR offer better performance for all KPIs and thus is the best model combining data confidentiality and attack detection in WSN.",

    "Abstract": "—Privacy protection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) constitutes a big challenge for the adoption of WSNs in data sensitive applications like health monitoring or tracking and surveillance of borders. Privacy protection require additional controls and communications overloads, which impact the overall network lifetime. Research community has proposed several scenarios to minimize the impact of data protection generally based on secure aggregation and encryption to meet the practical requirements of energy constraints imposed by WSN. However, efficiency of privacy protection must be assessed before deployment. The privacy protection mechanisms are evaluated based on their hackability and network performance using four main metrics: Control Packet Overhead, delay, Throughput, Packet delivery ratio. The purpose of this paper is to propose a secure aggregation scheme based on homomorphic encryption. The new scheme will be will be compared to another scheme based on network metric and attack detection accuracy to have full view on the scheme performance for both network and security metrics. The proposed scheme named “Cluster-based Semi-Homomophic Encryption Aggregated Data” (CSHEAD) offer better performance as it reduces the controls overhead with higher detection accuracy. The conducted simulations confirm the expected results.",

    "Title": "Sentiment analysis dataset in Moroccan dialect: bridging the gap between Arabic and Latin scripted dialect",
    "Abstract": "Sentiment analysis, the automated process of determining emotions or opinions expressed in text, has seen extensive exploration in the field of natural language processing. However, one aspect that has remained underrepresented is the sentiment analysis of the Moroccan dialect, which boasts a unique linguistic landscape and the coexistence of multiple scripts. Previous works in sentiment analysis primarily targeted dialects employing Arabic script. While these efforts provided valuable insights, they may not fully capture the complexity of Moroccan web content, which features a blend of Arabic and Latin script. As a result, our study emphasizes the importance of extending sentiment analysis to encompass the entire spectrum of Moroccan linguistic diversity. Central to our research is the creation of the largest public dataset for Moroccan dialect sentiment analysis that incorporates not only Moroccan dialect written in Arabic script but also in Latin characters. By assembling a diverse range of textual data, we were able to construct a dataset with a range of 19,991 manually labeled texts in Moroccan dialect and also publicly available lists of stop words in Moroccan dialect as a new contribution to Moroccan Arabic resources. In our exploration of sentiment analysis, we undertook a comprehensive study encompassing various machine-learning models to assess their compatibility with our dataset. While our investigation revealed that the highest accuracy of 98.42% was attained through the utilization of the DarijaBert-mix transfer-learning model, we also delved into deep learning models. Notably, our experimentation yielded a commendable accuracy rate of 92% when employing a CNN model. Furthermore, in an effort to affirm the reliability of our dataset, we tested the CNN model using smaller publicly available datasets of Moroccan dialect, with results that proved to be promising and supportive of our findings.",

    "Title": "ERABQS: entity resolution based on active machine learning and balancing query strategy",
    "Abstract": "Entity Resolution (ER) is a crucial process in the field of data management and integration. The primary goal of ER is to identify different profiles (or records) that refer to the same real-world entity across databases. The challenging problem is that labeling a large sample of profiles can be very expensive and time-consuming. Active Machine Learning (ActiveML) addresses this issue by selecting the most representative or informative profiles pairs to be labeled. The informativeness is determined by the capacity to diminish the uncertainty of the model. Conversely, representativeness evaluates whether a selected instance effectively reflects the overall input patterns of unlabeled data. Traditional ActiveML techniques typically rely on one strategy, Which may severely restrict the performance of the ActiveML process and lead to slow convergence. Especially in ER problems with a lack of initial training data. In this paper, we overcame this issue by inventing an approach for balancing the two above strategies. The implemented solution named EBEES (Epsilon-based Balancing Exploration and Exploitation Strategy), Which contains two variations: Adaptive-ϵ and ϵ-decreasing. We evaluated the EBEES on twelve datasets. Comparing the EBEES strategy against the state-of-the-art methods, without an initial training data, showed an enhanced performance in terms of F1-score, model stability, and rapid convergence.",

    "Title": "Enhancing Entity Resolution with a hybrid Active Machine Learning framework: Strategies for optimal learning in sparse datasets",
    "Abstract": "When solving the problem of identifying similar records in different datasets (known as Entity Resolution or ER), one big challenge is the lack of enough labeled data. Which is crucial for building strong machine learning models, but getting this data can be expensive and time-consuming. Active Machine Learning (ActiveML) is a helpful approach because it cleverly picks the most useful pieces of data to learn from. It uses two main ideas: informativeness and representativeness. Typical ActiveML methods used in ER usually depend too much on just one of these ideas, which can make them less effective, especially when starting with very little data. Our research introduces a new combined method that uses both ideas together. We created two versions of this method, called DPQ and STQ, and tested them on eleven different real-world datasets. The results showed that our new method improves ER by producing better scores, more stable models, and faster learning with less training data compared to existing methods.",

    "Title": "AN ONLINE ENSEMBLE LEARNING MODEL FOR DETECTING ATTACKS IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS",
    "Abstract": "In today’s modern world, the usage of technology is unavoidable, and the rapid advances in the Internet and communication fields have resulted in the expansion of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. However, WSN has been proven to be vulnerable to security breaches. The harsh and unattended deployment of these networks, combined with their constrained resources and the volume of data generated, introduces a major security concern. WSN applications are extremely critical, it is essential to build reliable solutions that involve fast and continuous mechanisms for online stream analysis, allowing the identification of attacks and intrusions. Our aim is to develop an intelligent and efficient intrusion detection system by applying an important machine learning concept known as ensemble learning in order to improve detection performance. Although ensemble models have been proven to be useful in offline learning, they have received less attention in streaming applications. In this paper, we examine the application of different homogeneous and heterogeneous online ensembles in sensory data analysis on a specialized WSN detection system (WSN-DS) dataset in order to classify four types of attacks: Blackhole attack, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling among normal network traffic. Among the proposed novel online ensembles, both the heterogeneous ensemble consisting of an Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) combined with the Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT) algorithm and the homogeneous ensemble HAT made up of 10 models achieved higher detection rates of 96.84 % and 97.2 %, respectively. The above models are efficient and effective in dealing with concept drift while taking into account WSN resource constraints.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we investigate the numerical performance of a continuous data assimilation algorithm based on ideas from the feedback control theory of dynamical systems, in the context of the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental mathematical model of epidemics. The motivation behind this work is to propose a new approach that estimates the infection rate parameter in the SEIR model. However, this model may have limited predictive value due to the idealized assumptions underlying it and measurement errors in the experimental data and parameters. We first implement this model as a paradigm because of its application to more realistic epidemic models, then we present our theoretical results. In addition, we provide numerous numerical simulations and significant examples to illustrate the first part of our work.",

    "Abstract": "The sharing of social media data has provided a significant amount of information about users. This has led to a growing interest in predicting user personality from social network data. Predicting user personality has potential applications in advertising and content recommendation systems, and can be a valuable source of insights for professionals seeking to understand and target their audiences on social media. This study focuses on the Instagram application and aims to extract and analyze the personality of Instagram users based on the content of their photos. Three categories of features are extracted from images: visual, emotional, and content. To describe users’ personalities, we used the Big Five model. One of the main contributions of this study is the creation of a comprehensive database that includes 316 Moroccan Instagram users. This database is the first of its kind to belong to Moroccan users. Additionally, The study also analyzed the influence of personality traits and gender on photo content by independently assessing the personalities of female and male Instagram users. Moreover, the personalities of each gender were extracted separately, and the influence of the number of images on prediction accuracy was studied. The study evaluates prediction accuracy using the root mean square error (RMSE) on a [1,5] score scale. Commendable results were achieved across all personality traits, with standout performance in predicting conscientiousness for females (RMSE=0.59) and openness for males (RMSE=0.59) compared to previous studies.",

FS is categorized as NP-Hard due to the high number of existing solutions. Various metaheuristic methods have been developed to address the FS problem, yielding promising results. Particularly, particle swarm optimization (PSO), an evolutionary computing (EC) approach guided by swarm intelligence, has gained widespread adoption owing to its implementation simplicity and potential for global search. This paper analyzes several variants of PSO algorithms and introduces a new FS method called HPSO. The proposed approach utilizes an asynchronously adaptive inertia weight and an improved constriction factor. Additionally, it incorporates a chaotic map and a MAD fitness function with a feature count penalty to tackle the clustering FS problem. The efficiency of the developed method is evaluated against the genetic algorithm (GA) and well-known variants of PSO algorithms, including PSOs with fixed inertia weights, PSOs with improved inertia weights, PSOs with fixed constriction factors, PSOs with improved constriction factors, PSOs with adaptive inertia weights, and PSO’s includes advanced learning exemplars and sophisticated structure topologies.

Several existing data mining techniques often through mining frequent itemsets draw association rules and get to relevant knowledge, but with the rapid arrival of the era of big data, traditional data mining algorithms have been impossible to meet large data's analysis needs.

    "Abstract": "Abstract—Privacy protection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) constitutes a big challenge for the adoption of WSNs in data sensitive applications like health monitoring or tracking and surveillance of borders. Privacy protection require additional controls and communications overloads, which impact the overall network lifetime. Research community has proposed several scenarios to minimize the impact of data protection generally based on secure aggregation and encryption to meet the practical requirements of energy constraints imposed by WSN. However, efficiency of privacy protection must be assessed before deployment. The privacy protection mechanisms are evaluated based on their hackability and network performance using four main metrics: Control Packet Overhead, delay, Throughput, Packet delivery ratio. The purpose of this paper is to propose a secure aggregation scheme based on homomorphic encryption. The new scheme will be will be compared to another scheme based on network metric and attack detection accuracy to have full view on the scheme performance for both network and security metrics. The proposed scheme named “Cluster-based Semi-Homomophic Encryption Aggregated Data”(CSHEAD) offer better performance as it reduces the controls overhead with higher detection accuracy. The conducted simulations confirm the expected results.",

Recently, the PrePost algorithm, a new algorithm for extraction frequent element sets based on the idea of N-lists, which in most cases surpasses other current state-of-the-art algorithms, has been introduced. The PrePost algorithm's performance deteriorates when it comes to handling big data. Nevertheless, the current existing PrePost algorithms in place implemented with the MapReduce model are not sufficiently powerful for iterative computation. To reduce IO overhead and take advantage of cluster memory, this article offers an enhanced version of PrePost, the Distributed PrePost (DisPrePost), a parallel algorithm built on the Spark framework, which incorporates the concept of resilient distributed datasets and performs in-memory processing to optimize the execution time of operation, that also utilises a HashMap to further refine the N-list creation process.

    "Abstract": "Frequent Itemsets Mining (FIM), which consists of extracting frequent patterns from a transactional database, is considered one of the most successful techniques in data mining. Generally, the FIM problem can be solved by either the exact or metaheuristic-based methods. Exact methods, such as the Apriori algorithm, are highly effective for dealing with small to medium datasets. However, these methods need more temporal complexity when dealing with large datasets. Metaheuristic-based methods are becoming more rapid, but the majority still need to be more precise. Several studies were carried out to address these issues and improve metaheuristics-based approaches by combining the Apriori algorithm with several metaheuristics algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The result of this combination gave birth to two approaches: GA-Apriori and PSO-Apriori. Consequently, after performing several studies on different database instances, the results revealed that the two approaches outperformed the Apriori algorithm in terms of runtime. PSO-Apriori also beats GA-Apriori in terms of both runtime and solution efficiency.",

    "Title": "A modified choice function hyper-heuristic with Boltzmann function",
    "Abstract": "Hyper-heuristics are a subclass of high-level research methods that function in a low-level heuristic research space. Their aim objective is to improve the level of generality for solving combinatorial optimization problems using two main components: a methodology for the heuristic selection and a move acceptance criterion, to ensure intensification and diversification [1]. Thus, rather than working directly on the problem’s solutions and selecting one of them to proceed to the next step at each stage, hyper-heuristics operates on a low-level heuristic research space. The choice function is one of the hyper-heuristics that have proven their efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems [2–4]. At each iteration, the selection of heuristics is dependent on a score calculated by combining three different measures to guarantee both intensification and diversification for the heuristics choice process. The heuristic with the highest score is therefore chosen to be applied to the problem. Therefore, the key to the success of the choice function is to choose the correct weight parameters of its three measures. In this study, we make a state of the art in hyper-heuristic research and propose a new method that automatically controls these weight parameters based on the Boltzmann function. The results obtained from its application on five problem domains are compared with those of the standard, modified choice function proposed by Drake et al.[2, 3].",

    "Abstract": "Today, the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) has become one of the most widely used texture descriptors thanks to its invariance and efficiency. The basic LBP method encodes local features by considering the difference in the local neighbourhood to represent a given image using the binary pattern histogram. Without performing the histogram step, the LBP method could be used to detect edges in an image. In this paper, two algorithms for edge detection are proposed. They are based on modifying the principle of the LBP method where a local neighbourhood is coded in binary by integrating a criterion of its homogeneity. In this work, we define this criterion as the ratio of the total variation in the whole image to the local variation of the neighbourhood. Thus, a new approach of edge detection is presented in two versions according to the way of calculating the differences in a neighbourhood. Experimental results on a standard natural image database show that the two proposed algorithms significantly improve the MSE, PSNR and SSIM indicators of the famous Canny detector and the improved LBP approach. In noisy conditions, our proposed algorithms present a better robustness to three types of noise.",

    "Title": "Cued Speech automatic recognition in normal-hearing and deaf subjects",
    "Abstract": "This article discusses the automatic recognition of Cued Speech in French based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Cued Speech is a visual mode which, by using hand shapes in different positions and in combination with lip patterns of speech, makes all the sounds of a spoken language clearly understandable to deaf people. The aim of Cued Speech is to overcome the problems of lipreading and thus enable deaf children and adults to understand spoken language completely. In the current study, the authors demonstrate that visible gestures are as discriminant as audible orofacial gestures. Phoneme recognition and isolated word recognition experiments have been conducted using data from a normal-hearing cuer. The results obtained were very promising, and the study has been extended by applying the proposed methods to a deaf cuer. The achieved results have not shown any significant differences compared to automatic Cued Speech recognition in a normal-hearing subject. In automatic recognition of Cued Speech, lip shape and gesture recognition are required. Moreover, the integration of the two modalities is of great importance. In this study, lip shape component is fused with hand component to realize Cued Speech recognition. Using concatenative feature fusion and multi-stream HMM decision fusion, vowel recognition, consonant recognition, and isolated word recognition experiments have been conducted. For vowel recognition, an 87.6% vowel accuracy was obtained showing a 61.3% relative improvement compared to the sole use of lip shape parameters. In the case of consonant recognition, a 78.9% accuracy was obtained showing a 56% relative improvement compared to the use of lip shape only. In addition to vowel and consonant recognition, a complete phoneme recognition experiment using concatenated feature vectors and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) discrimination was conducted, obtaining a 74.4% phoneme accuracy. Isolated word recognition experiments in both normal-hearing and deaf subjects were also conducted providing a word accuracy of 94.9% and 89%, respectively. The obtained results were compared with those obtained using audio signal, and comparable accuracies were observed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Cued Speech is a visual mode of communication that uses handshapes and placements in combination with the mouth movements of speech to make the phonemes of a spoken language look different from each other and clearly understandable to deaf and hearing-impaired people. The aim of Cued Speech is to overcome the problems of lip reading and thus enable deaf children and adults to wholly understand spoken language. Cued Speech recognition requires hand gesture recognition and lip shape recognition, and also integration of the two components. This article presents hidden Markov model (HMM)-based vowel recognition as used in Cued Speech for French. Based on concatenative feature fusion and multistream HMM decision fusion, lip shape and hand position components were integrated into a single component, and automatic vowel recognition was realized. In the case of multistream HMM decision fusion, the obtained vowel classification accuracy using lip shape and hand position information was 87.6%, showing absolute improvement of 19.6% in comparison with a use restricted only to lip parameters. © 2009 IEEE.",

    "Title": "Unsupervised phoneme segmentation of continuous Arabic speech",
    "Abstract": "The development of a speech recognition system for the Arabic language presents a significant challenge, mainly due to the limited availability of digital resources specific to this language. To achieve vocabulary-independent speech recognition, it is essential to split a given speech into smaller units known as phonemes or syllables. This process is what we call speech segmentation; it plays a crucial role in accurately recognizing and understanding speech patterns. Many speech segmentation techniques have been developed, relying on linguistic information such as phonetic transcription. However, for real-time systems, phonetic transcription is not always available, especially for low-resource languages like Arabic. In this paper, we addressed the problem of unsupervised segmentation for continuous Arabic speech based on two distinct approaches: spectral contrast and the first derivative of Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (Δ-MFCCs), incorporating an adaptive threshold to determine the phoneme boundaries without needing any external knowledge. The intersection-over-union (IoU) was integrated into our study to match reference boundaries and the generated borders. As far as we know, the majority of works use this technique for image processing; we effectively adapted it to the realm of speech processing, accomplishing a noteworthy level of matching success. The Arabic speech corpus was used to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed methods. By comparing the performance of our methods to other approaches, we were able to assess their strengths. Notably, our method, which made use of Δ-MFCCs, showcased a substantial performance improvement of 14%.",

    "Abstract": "Handwriting recognition, particularly for Arabic, is a very challenging field of research due to various complex factors, such as the presence of ligatures, cursive writing style, slant variations, diacritics, overlapping and other difficult problems. This paper specifically addresses the task of recognizing offline Arabic handwritten text lines. The main contributions include the pre-processing stage and the utilization of a deep learning-based approach with data-augmentation techniques. The pre-processing step involves correcting the skew of text-lines and removing any unnecessary white space in images. The deep-learning architecture consists of a Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional Block Attention Module for feature extraction, along with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory for sequence modeling and Connectionist Temporal Classification as a decoder. Data-augmentation techniques are utilized on the images in the database to enhance the system’s ability to recognize a wide range of Arabic characters and to extend the level of abstraction in patterns due to synthetic variations. Our suggested approach has the capability of precisely recognizing Arabic handwritten texts without the necessity of character segmentation, thereby resolving various issues associated with this aspect. The results obtained from the KHATT database highlight the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating a Word Error Rate of 14.55% and a Character Error Rate of 3.25%.",

    "Title": "View-independent Vehicle Category Classification System",
    "Abstract": "Vehicle category classification is important, but it is a challenging task, especially, when the vehicles are captured from a surveillance camera with different view angles. This paper aims to develop a view-independent vehicle category classification system. It proposes a two-phase system: one phase recognizes the view angles helping the second phase to recognize the vehicle category including bus, car, motorcycle, and truck. In each phase, several descriptors and Machine Learning techniques including traditional algorithms and Deep neural networks are employed. In particular, we used three descriptors: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradient), LBP (Local Binary Patterns) and Gabor filter with two classifiers SVM (Support Vector Machine) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor). And also, we used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet). Three experiments have been elaborated based on many datasets. The first experiment is dedicated to choosing the best approach for the recognition of views: rear or front. The second experiment aims to classify the vehicle categories based on each view. In the third experiment, we developed the overall system, the categories were classified independently of the view. Experimental results reveal that CNN gives the highest recognition accuracy of 94.29% in the first experiment, and HOG with SVM or k-NN gives the best results (99.58%, 99.17%) in the second experiment. The system can robustly recognize vehicle categories with an accuracy of 95.77%.",

Nevertheless, recognizing historical Arabic manuscripts remains a considerable challenge. The purpose of this study is to investigate subword recognition in historical Arabic manuscripts. Two systems are established. The first system involves using a variety of handcrafted feature methods with diverse machine learning algorithms. The second system uses a deep learning architecture that integrates convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory based on a character model approach with connectionist temporal classification as a decoder. By utilizing the IBN SINA dataset, the histogram of oriented gradients descriptor demonstrated superior performance in the first system, while the second system achieved notable results.

    "Abstract": "The sharing of social media data has provided a significant amount of information about users. This has led to a growing interest in predicting user personality from social network data. Predicting user personality has potential applications in advertising and content recommendation systems, and can be a valuable source of insights for professionals seeking to understand and target their audiences on social media. This study focuses on the Instagram application and aims to extract and analyze the personality of Instagram users based on the content of their photos. Three categories of features are extracted from images: visual, emotional, and content. To describe users’ personalities, we used the Big Five model. One of the main contributions of this study is the creation of a comprehensive database that includes 316 Moroccan Instagram users. This database is the first of its kind to belong to Moroccan users. Additionally, The study also analyzed the influence of personality traits and gender on photo content by independently assessing the personalities of female and male Instagram users. Moreover, the personalities of each gender were extracted separately, and the influence of the number of images on prediction accuracy was studied. The study evaluates prediction accuracy using the root mean square error (RMSE) on a [1,5] score scale. Commendable results were achieved across all personality traits, with standout performance in predicting conscientiousness for females (RMSE=0.59) and openness for males (RMSE=0.59) compared to previous studies.",

Our approach is based on two main phases: Line Detection and Vehicle Detection. In this work, we focus on the vehicle detection stage.

Then, we merged the best descriptors to combine the advantages of their different robustness in order to build a strong vehicle detection model. The performances of all constructed models are evaluated on the GTI database. In a second experiment, illumination normalization techniques were applied to image database for the effective models. Thus, the first experimental results reveal that the combination HOG+ LBP+ Gabor Phase performs well with SVM.

An efficient and noise-robust VAD system can be widely used for emerging speech technologies such as wireless communication and speech recognition. In this paper, we propose two versions of an unsupervised Arabic VAD method based on the combination of the Short-Time Energy (STE) and the Spectral Centroid (SC) features for formulating a typical threshold to detect speech areas. The first version compares only the STE feature to the threshold (STE-VAD). In contrast, the second compares the SC vector and the threshold (SC-VAD). The two versions of our VAD method were tested on 770 sentences of the Arabphone corpus, which were recorded in clean and noisy environments and evaluated under different values of Signal-to-Noise-Ratio. The experiments demonstrated the robustness of the STE-VAD in terms of accuracy and Mean Square Error.",

They are based on modifying the principle of the LBP method where a local neighbourhood is coded in binary by integrating a criterion of its homogeneity. In this work, we define this criterion as the ratio of the total variation in the whole image to the local variation of the neighbourhood. Thus, a new approach of edge detection is presented in two versions according to the way of calculating the differences in a neighbourhood. Experimental results on a …",

The tests were conducted using the Openstack platform. One of the key benefits of this proposed approach is the improved performance in effectively detecting a significant number of malicious packets. We implemented this solution on the Openstack platform and conducted evaluations to demonstrate its efficacy. The results confirm that our method achieves superior performance in detecting MitM attacks, with a packet detection ratio (PDR) of 60.4%.

The two versions of our VAD method were tested on 770 sentences of the Arabphone corpus, which were recorded in clean and noisy environments and evaluated under different values of Signal-to-Noise-Ratio. The experiments demonstrated the robustness of the STE-VAD in terms of …",

    "Title": "IGAEM: Improved Genetic Algorithm based Entity Matching",
    "Abstract": "The presence of duplicate records is a major data quality concern in huge datasets. To detect duplicates, entity matching is used as an essential step of the data cleaning process to map records that refer to the same real-world entity. Most of proposed algorithms require labeled data in order to train a classifier. However, we cannot always obtain labeled data. In our paper we propose an unsupervised approach for entity matching problem using an improved version of genetic algorithm. We explain the main improvements added to genetic algorithm and the encoding strategy to encode partitions in the form of a chromosome. Different similarity functions are used to compute similarities between records. The obtained results prove that our proposition stands as a powerful approach in the entity matching field where it outperforms the traditional genetic algorithm based approach.",

    "Title": "Automatic recognition of French Cued Speech using multimodal fusion based on hidden Markov models",
    "Abstract": "Cued Speech based on hidden Markov models (HMM) is presented. Cued Speech is a visual system which uses handshapes in different positions and in combination with lip-patterns of speech, and makes all the sounds of spoken language clearly understandable to deaf and hearing-impaired people. The aim of Cued Speech is to overcome the problems of lipreading and thus enable deaf children and adults to understand full spoken language. In automatic recognition of Cued Speech, lip shape and gesture recognition are required. In addition, the integration of the two modalities is of the greatest importance. In this study, lip shape component is fused with gestures components to realize Cued Speech recognition. Using concatenative feature fusion and multi-stream HMM decision fusion, vowel recognition and consonant recognition experiments have been conducted. For vowel recognition, an 87.6% vowel accuracy was obtained showing a 61.3% relative improvement compared to the sole use of lip shape parameters. In the case of consonant recognition, a 78.9% accuracy was obtained showing a 56% relative improvement compared with the use of lip shape only. In addition to vowel and consonant recognition, a complete phoneme recognition experiment using concatenated feature vectors and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) discrimination has been conducted showing a 74.4% phoneme accuracy. The obtained results were compared to the results obtained using the audio signal showing comparable accuracies. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches as far as Cued Speech recognition is concerned.",

We propose to solve the considered inverse problem using shape optimization methods, which are well-suited to this type of problem. In this direction, we demonstrate that the state variable corresponding to the advection-diffusion problem is differentiable with respect to the shape, and we rigorously derive its material derivative. The problem is recast into two different shape optimization formulations, and the corresponding shape derivatives of the cost functions – in boundary integral forms – are obtained by introducing appropriate adjoint systems. The shape gradient information is then used in a gradient-based scheme to approximate a solution to the optimization problems. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed numerical methods in two spatial dimensions.",

We reformulate this problem into an optimal control problem with total variational (TV) as regularization term. We prove the existent of the minimizer after obtaining the regularity of the solution of our direct system by the Mittag-Leffler function. To solve the TV-regularized problem, we use the alternating direction multiplier method. Thus, we show that one of the sub-problems of ADMM can be well solved by the descent gradient algorithm, and the other one can be efficiently solved by the proximal operator implementation. This last method will be efficiently improved by means of deep neural networks.

It has become necessary to adopt a set of agricultural practices based on advanced technologies. Agriculture 4.0 enables farms to create added value by combining innovative technologies, such as precision agriculture, information and communication technology, robotics, and Big Data. As an enterprise, a connected farm is highly sensitive to strategic changes in organizational structures, objectives, modified variety, new business objects, processes, etc. To control the farm’s information system strategically, we proposed a metamodel based on the ISO/IS 19440 standard, where we added some new constructs relating to advanced digital technologies for smart and connected agriculture. We applied the proposed metamodel to the crop classification prediction process. This involved using machine learning methods such as recurrent neural networks to predict the type of crop being grown in a given agricultural area. Our research bridges farming with modern technology through our metamodel for a connected farm, promoting sustainability and efficiency. Furthermore, our crop classification study demonstrates the power of advanced machine learning, guided by our metamodel, in accurately predicting crop conditions, emphasizing its potential for crop management and food security.

On the unknown boundary, a Robin homogeneous condition is assumed. For a fixed constant impedance α, it was shown by Cakoni and Kress in [1] through concrete examples that a single measurement of (f, g) on Σ can give rise to infinitely many different domains Ω. Nonetheless, shape optimization techniques can provide fair detections of the unknown boundary given a single pair of Cauchy data as we will showcase here. On this purpose, the inverse problem is recast into three different shape optimization formulations and the shape derivative of the cost function associated with each formulations are obtained. The shape gradient informations are then utilized in a Sobolev gradient-based scheme via finite element method to solve the optimization problems.

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a deep learning neural network approach to precisely identify space-dependent diffusion coefficients within a time-fractional diffusion equation by leveraging a learned primal-dual algorithm. To improve the accuracy of coefficient identification, our approach utilizes supplementary measurement data obtained at the final time. First, a deep neural network is employed to estimate the diffusion coefficient within the direct problem formulation, which is a crucial initial step in effectively characterizing the behavior of the diffusion process. Subsequently, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for the corresponding direct problem under a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. By parameterizing the solution using a deep neural network, we reinforce the foundation of our approach. This enables us to reformulate the inverse problem as a non-smooth optimal control problem, and we successfully demonstrate the existence of a solution for this control problem. To this end, we employ three types of primal-dual methods to efficiently address and numerically solve the complex inverse problem. The first primal-dual algorithm used is the classic Chambolle and Pock algorithm. In the second, we replace the dual's proximal operator with a trained convolutional neural network. In the third primal-dual algorithm, both proximal operators are replaced with trained models. We conduct extensive numerical experiments in a two-dimensional domain, and the results highlight the remarkable effectiveness and stability of our proposed method. By demonstrating its applicability and reliability, we underscore the potential of our approach for solving real-world problems related to the identification of diffusion coefficients.",

This trained PDE is employed to prevent the low-level features from deteriorating, which is needed for tasks involving denoising. In fact, we introduce an improved network architecture for a denoising network entitled VPDNet through an optimal control problem. More precisely, the network architecture is governed by an explicit Euler discretization of a reaction–diffusion system.

    "Title": "An Optimal Fluid Optical Flow Registration for Super-resolution with Lamé Parameters Learning",
    "Abstract": "The main idea of multi-frame super-resolution (SR) algorithms is to recover a single high-resolution image through a series of low-resolution ones of a captured scene. The success of the SR approaches is often related to well registration and restoration steps. In this work, we propose a new approach based on fluid optical flow image registration and a second-order regularization term to treat both the registration and restoration steps. The fluid registration is introduced to avoid misregistration errors, while the second-order regularization resolved by the Bregman iteration is employed to reduce the image artifacts. Moreover, we propose a bilevel supervised learning framework to compute the Lamé coefficients λ and μ, which perform the nonparametric registration of the super-resolution result. The numerical part demonstrated that the proposed method copes with some competitive SR methods.",

This paper proposes a new anisotropic diffusion model for image denoising, especially in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), based on a nonlinear reaction–diffusion system. This model is driven by using the decomposition strategy of the H- 1 norm, which is suitable for illustrating the small features in the textured image. Using the Schauder fixed point theorem, we have checked the well-posedness of the suggested reaction–diffusion system within a suitable framework.

In order to solve this problem, we use the coupled com- plex boundary method (CCBM), originaly proposed in [16]. The new method transforms our inverse problem to a complex boundary problem with a com- plex Robin boundary condition coupling the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary data. Then, we optimize the shape cost function constructed by the imaginary part of the solution in the whole domain in order to determine the inclusion ω. Thanks to the tools of shape optimization, we prove the existence of the shape derivative of the complex state with respect to the domain ω. We characterize the gradient of the cost functional in order to make a numerical resolution. We then investigate the stability of the optimization problem and explain why this inverse problem is severely ill-posed by proving compactness of the Hessian of cost functional at the critical shape.

    "Abstract": "This paper treats the inverse denoising problem which aims to compute simultaneously the clean image and the weighting parameter λ. The formulated denoising problem is posed using a partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization model. The minimized function imposes a Tikhonov regularization on the estimated λ, while the proposed PDE encompasses two high-order diffusive tensors. The particularity of this PDE is that it does not over-smooth homogeneous regions and preserves sharp edges during the denoising process, even if its degree is high. A new optimization procedure to compute the weighting parameter is also elaborated inspired from the nonsmooth Primal-dual algorithm. This leads to control of the diffusivity rate generated by the two diffusive operators. Finally, expressive results show that the computed spatial parameter λ leads to obtain a pleasant clean image. This is also confirmed by numerous comparisons with other competitive denoising approaches.",

Secondly, we establish the existence of the minimizer for the optimal control problem corresponding to the L1 cost function, since it is the general case. Thirdly, we present some numerical results for the different cases of the cost function. These results are based on solving the optimal control model by gradient method for the L2 case and the primal-dual method for non-smooth L1 norm.

    "Abstract": "The dose optimization algorithm based on anatomical points is developed to produce rapidly uniform doses over target distances generated on the target volume edges in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy stepping source application for a treatment length of 6 cm. Monte Carlo modeling of the 60Co HDR brachytherapy source and the surrounding medium were performed using PHITS code. The source dwell times were optimized using Tikhonov regularization in order to obtain uniform dose distribution at the anatomical points located at predefined target distances. The computed dose rates at distances from 0.25 up to 20 cm away from the source were first verified with the literature data sets. Then, the simulation results of the optimization process were compared to the calculations of commercial treatment planning system (TPS) SagiPlan. As a result, the dose uniformity was observed in the isodose curves at the target distances of 10 and 15 mm of the treatment length and the prescribed dose achieved the anatomical points uniformly. The algorithm developed in the present study can be applied for achieving the dose uniformity around the brachytherapy stepping source as a quicker tool for different treatment lengths and different target distances while maintaining the high quality of the treatment plans, saving time by avoiding the manual isodose shaping and then better suitable treatment for patients.",

This inverse problem—known as electrical impedance tomography—has many important practical applications and hence has been the focus of much attention during the past few years.

In the shape optimization literature, the use of schemes requiring the second derivative have tended to be less popular than schemes that require at most a single derivative. In particular, in the literature on inverse problems of shape reconstruction, it is rare to use derivatives higher than the first order. There are two main reasons for avoiding the use of second derivatives. The first is that second order shape derivatives are difficult to compute. The second reason is essentially numerical: in general, the implementational and computational effort of computing the Hessian is not repaid by a significant reduction of the number of",

In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear constrained-PDE based on the fractional order tensor diffusion to approximate the clean image and also the impulse component in a mixture of Gaussian and impulse noise. Our model offers an ideal compromise between the edge preservation, staircasing creation and the loss of image contrasts. The proposed constrained-PDE is formulated using a variational model that features a L 1 data discrepancy encoding the impulse noise and an L 2 term of the clean image, which is a solution of a high-order PDE. Then, a rigorous analysis of the existence of the solution to the proposed model is checked in a suitable functional framework.

    "Abstract": "The main idea of multi-frame super-resolution (SR) algorithms is to recover a single high-resolution image through a series of low-resolution ones of a captured scene. The success of the SR approaches is often related to well registration and restoration steps. In this work, we propose a new approach based on fluid optical flow image registration and a second-order regularization term to treat both the registration and restoration steps. The fluid registration is introduced to avoid misregistration errors, while the second-order regularization resolved by the Bregman iteration is employed to reduce the image artifacts. Moreover, we propose a bilevel supervised learning framework to compute the Lamé coefficients and , which perform the nonparametric registration of the super-resolution result. The numerical part demonstrated that the proposed method copes with some competitive SR methods.",

    "Title": "On Incidence-Dependent Management Strategies against an SEIRS Epidemic: Extinction of the Epidemic Using Allee Effect",
    "Abstract": "We developed a mathematical model to study the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the dynamics of an epidemic. The level of intervention was assessed as a fraction of the population being isolated and depended on the level of incidence of the epidemic in the population. We performed a mathematical analysis of the model and showed that, depending on the choice of the prevalence-dependent isolation function, it is possible to create new endemic equilibria and to change the stability of the disease-free equilibrium for which the epidemic vanishes. The model was then applied to the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several NPI management strategies were considered. In the case of an NPI intensity increasing with the level of infection, it is possible to avoid the initial epidemic peak of great amplitude that would have occurred without intervention and to stabilize the epidemic at a chosen and sufficiently low endemic level. In the case of an NPI intensity decreasing with the level of infection, the epidemic can be driven to extinction by generating an “Allee” effect: when the incidence is below a given level, the epidemic goes extinct whereas, above it, the epidemic will still be able take hold at a lower endemic level. Simulations illustrate that appropriate NPIs could make the COVID-19 vanish relatively fast. We show that, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have not chosen to use the most efficient strategies.",

Specifically, we examine the effects of reducing contacts among individuals at a particular time m by a factor of q > 1, such that R0/q < 1. Our analysis reveals that in this case, the final size of the epidemic can be approximated by the formula RmR0(1−1/q)/(1−R0/q), where Rm denotes the cumulative number of cases at date m and R0 is the basic reproductive number. We also explore the situation where contacts are entirely eliminated at an early stage of the epidemic, i.e., when q → ∞. Our results indicate that in such cases, the final size of the epidemic can be estimated by multiplying the cumulative number of cases Rm at that date by the basic reproductive number R0. Our study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of intervention strategies in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. We anticipate that our findings will be of interest to researchers, policymakers, and public health officials.",

    "Title": "Coupling of Bio-Reactors to Increase Maximum Sustainable Yield",
    "Abstract": "In the field of fisheries management, the objective is to obtain an optimal catch while maintaining the fishery resource at a sufficiently high level to avoid the extinction of the exploited species. In mathematical fishery models, the fishing effort that must be implemented to have a sustainable fishery with a maximum harvest rate in the long term is sought. This goal is called the “Maximum Sustainable Yield” (MSY). In the chemostat, the substrate can be seen as prey of which the predator is the product. MSY search is thus extended to the classical chemostat model with a Monod function. There exists a dilution rate that maximizes the product synthesis. The study is extended to the case of the gradostat with fast substrate and product exchanges between two coupled bioreactors. The existence of two time scales makes it possible to apply methods of aggregation of variables to derive a reduced model governing a few global variables describing the dynamics of the complete system at the slow time scale. The analysis of the mathematical aggregated model is performed. Existence of equilibria as well as local and global stability are studied. The overall product yield in the system of coupled bioreactors may be greater than the sum of the yields of the two uncoupled bioreactors, i.e., if they functioned without connection between them. The increase in product yield is all the more important as the distribution of the substrate and of the product is asymmetrical between the two coupled bioreactors. The model is applied to fish farming by considering the coupling of two breeding sites. Here again, the model makes it possible to find the fast fish exchanges that must be established between the two breeding basins to optimize the overall yield of the farm.",

It was shown that the infection may persist at a certain level alongside a chronic immune response, exhibiting spatially uniform or oscillatory behavior. Finally, the immune cells may become entirely depleted, leading to a high viral load persisting in the tissue.

By determining the expected peak time, they can allocate resources effectively and implement measures such as quarantine, vaccination, and treatment at the right time to mitigate the spread of the disease. The peak time also provides valuable information for those modeling the spread of the epidemic and making predictions about its future trajectory. In this study, we analyze the time needed for an epidemic to reach its peak by presenting a straightforward analytical expression. Utilizing two epidemiological models, the first is a generalized S EIR model with two classes of latent individuals, while the second incorporates a continuous age structure for latent infections. We confirm the conjecture that the peak occurs at approximately T ∼ (ln N)/λ, where N is the population size and λ is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized system in the first model or the unique positive root of the characteristic equation in the second model. Our analytical results are compared to numerical solutions and shown to be in good agreement.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a prey–predator community of fish coexisting in a multi-patches model, where different fishing patches are interconnected through migration terms. Only the predator is caught, while the prey grows logistically on each patch. The main objective of our research is to compare the maximum sustainable yield achieved in two contrasting scenarios: unconnected patches and connected patches with rapid stock movements. We show that the total maximum sustainable yield for the connected patches can be greater than the sum of the maximum sustainable yield on each isolated patch. The analysis of the model allows us to establish the conditions under which one of the two cases is more favorable from the viewpoint of yield. As a result, we provide a complete classification for all possible cases. This valuable information can be used to assist decision-makers in selecting the best management strategy for a particular fishery.",

    "Title": "Increase of maximum sustainable yield for fishery in two patches with fast migration",
    "Abstract": "We present a model of a fish population present on two patches connected by migrations. Fish grow logistically on each patch and are caught. We assume that migrations between the two sites are fast relative to local growth and fishing. Taking advantage of the time scales, we use methods of aggregation of variables to obtain a reduced model governing the total biomass of the fish population at a slow time scale. We are looking for the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the system of the two connected patches. We show that although the total equilibrium population may be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities on each isolated site, the total catch is always less than or equal to the sum of the catches on the isolated fishing sites. We then consider a prey–predator community of fish in the same environment. We assume that only the predator is caught and not its prey, growing logistically on each site. We study the Lotka–Volterra prey–predator model as well as the model with a type II Holling functional response. We show that the total catch at MSY of the system of connected sites can be greater than the sum of the captures on each isolated site. This result is obtained when a fishing site with a large prey carrying capacity and an average growth rate is connected to a site with a small carrying capacity but a large growth rate. Finally, we discuss fishery management methods on two fishing sites for the Lotka–Volterra model as well as the Holling type II model in the case of a prey refuge.",

    "Title": "On a two-strain epidemic model involving delay equations",
    "Abstract": "We propose an epidemiological model for the interaction of either two viruses or viral strains with cross-immunity, where the individuals infected by the first virus cannot be infected by the second one, and without cross-immunity, where a secondary infection can occur. The model incorporates distributed recovery and death rates and consists of integro-differential equations governing the dynamics of susceptible, infectious, recovered, and dead compartments. Assuming that the recovery and death rates are uniformly distributed in time throughout the duration of the diseases, we can simplify the model to a conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. Another limiting case arises if the recovery and death rates are approximated by the delta-function, thereby resulting in a new point-wise delay model that incorporates two time delays corresponding to the durations of the diseases. We establish the positiveness of solutions for the distributed delay models and determine the basic reproduction number and an estimate for the final size of the epidemic for the delay model. According to the results of the numerical simulations, both strains can coexist in the population if the disease transmission rates for them are close to each other. If the difference between them is sufficiently large, then one of the strains dominates and eliminates the other one.",

    "Title": "Sustainable management of predatory fish affected by an Allee effect through marine protected areas and taxation",
    "Abstract": "Ecological balance and stable economic development are crucial for the fishery. This study proposes a predator–prey system for marine communities, where the growth of predators follows the Allee effect and takes into account the rapid fluctuations in resource prices caused by supply and demand. The system predicts the existence of catastrophic equilibrium, which may lead to the extinction of prey, consequently leading to the extinction of predators, but fishing efforts remain high. Marine protected areas are established near fishing areas to avoid such situations. Fish migrate rapidly between these two areas and are only harvested in the nonprotected areas. A three-dimensional simplified model is derived by applying variable aggregation to describe the variation of global variables on a slow time scale. To seek conditions to avoid species extinction and maintain sustainable fishing activities, the existence of positive equilibrium points and their local stability are explored based on the simplified model. Moreover, the long-term impact of establishing marine protected areas and levying taxes based on unit catch on fishery dynamics is studied, and the optimal tax policy is obtained by applying Pontryagin's maximum principle. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples of this study demonstrate the comprehensive effectiveness of increasing the proportion of marine protected areas and controlling taxes on the sustainable development of fishery.",

    "Title": "A bioeconomic model of a fishery with saturated catch and variable price: Stabilizing effect of marine reserves on fishery dynamics",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, we study a mathematical bio-economic model of a fishery with varying price. The three dimensional model describes the time evolution of the resource, the fishing effort and the price. The model is original because it considers a nonlinear harvesting function assumed to depend upon stock size and fishing effort with a saturation effect with respect to the resource as well as a price equation depending on demand and supply which is in addition proportional to price. Assuming that the price varies at a fast time scale, we are able to use ”aggregation of variables methods” in order to reduce the model in a two dimensional model at a slow time scale. This aggregated (reduced) model is analyzed. Several numerical simulations of the model are performed to substantiate our analytical findings. The existence of nonlinear harvesting makes the dynamics of the model more complicated, including multiple equilibria, bi-stability and limit cycle. Such large amplitude cycle variations are not desirable because they generate periods of overfishing at periods of very low activity. We then study the effects of marine reserves on the dynamics of the fishery, showing that for an adequate number of small reserves, limit cycle oscillations are switched off.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to study a mathematical model describing the dynamics of malaria transmission. The model tracks that humans gain a temporary immunity but they can still transmit the disease to susceptible mosquitoes with a probability less than that of infected humans. Furthermore, we take in consideration both return from the semi-immune class as a probability of loss of immunity and the return from the infected directly to the susceptible class. We investigate the existence of both trivial and non trivial equilibria and their stability. We show how to estimate the size of different human populations using the host incidence which is, in general, the only available information. To this end, we construct some observers or “software sensors” that allow to dynamically estimate the non-measured state variables. We also provide some strategies to control the disease using Lyapunov control functions.",

Furthermore, we establish conditions under which fragmentation and nonlinear asymmetrical migration can lead to a total equilibrium population that is either greater or smaller than the sum of carrying capacities. Finally, for the two-patch model, we classify the model parameter space to determine if nonlinear dispersal is beneficial or detrimental to the sum of two carrying capacities.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a predator–prey fishery model with prey harvesting, variable price and marine protected area. We assume the price changes faster than other processes such as population growth and predation, and get a slow fast Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system. A simplified three-dimensional model is obtained by using approximate aggregation methods. The results show that there are two main scenarios, one is the depletion of fish stocks due to overfishing by fishermen, which is called a “catastrophic” equilibrium; and the other is a stable and sustainable fishery equilibrium. In order to avoid the extinction of fish, we consider establishing marine protected area (MPA) near fishing areas where fishermen only catch the prey. The results of the study provide the conditions for the establishment of MPA, allowing us to avoid the extinction of prey populations and establish sustainable fisheries. As another possibility, we consider increasing taxes to discourage overfishing by fishermen. In addition, when the tax revenue increases, the optimal harvest strategy is obtained. The optimal policy ensures the sustainable development of fisheries and maximizes the interests of fishermen.",

    "Title": "Transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Algeria: The impact of physical distancing and face masks",
    "Abstract": "We propose an SIR epidemic model taking into account prevention measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) such as wearing masks and respecting safety distances. We look for the conditions to avoid a second epidemic peak in the phase of release from confinement. We derive equations for the critical levels of mask efficiency, mask adoption (fraction of population wearing masks) and fraction of population engaging in physical distancing that lower the basic reproduction number R0 to unity. Conclusions: For R0 = 2.5, if at least 40% of people wear masks with efficiency 50%, and at least 20% of the population without masks (or anti-maskers) respect physical distancing measures, the effective reproduction number can be reduced to less than 1 and COVID-19 infections would plummet. The model predicts also that if at least half of the people respecting physical distancing, COVID-19 outbreaks with R0 of about 3, would be theoretically extinguished without wearing masks. The results of this study provide an alternative explanation for the spread of the disease, and suggest some valuable policy recommendations about the control strategies applied to mitigate disease transmission.",

    "Title": "OPTIMAL PLACEMENT OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS TO AVOID THE EXTINCTION OF THE FISH STOCK",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose to study a fishery model with variable price. We assume that the price evolves much faster than the rest of the system. Under certain assumptions, this makes it possible to consider the fishery system as a slow-fast system, on two time scales, and to study it with a reduced model of dimension two. Two main cases can occur. The first one which we called catastrophic equilibrium corresponds to over-exploitation leading to fish extinction and a booming price. The second case corresponds to a sustainable fishery equilibrium which is stable. The possible effects of the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), sites where fishing is prohibited, on the fish stock and fishery are evaluated. We show that MPAs can have a positive effect on the restoration of depleted fish stocks by destabilizing the catastrophic equilibrium and keeping only one positive equilibrium which will be globally asymptotically stable. This problem is addressed by proposing a model with MPA for the fish dynamics. Fish are assumed to move between MPA and fishing area and are subject to harvesting through fishing. We show that to avoid the extinction of the stock and stabilize the fishery in the long term, it is necessary to define a fishing zone such that the ratio of its carrying capacity to its surface is small enough. We further show that with a judicious choice of the surface area of the MPA, it is possible to optimize the total capture.",

Rapid price changes classify the fishery system as a slow–fast system. Two main cases arise: catastrophic equilibrium (CE) with overexploitation and fish extinction, and a sustainable fishery equilibrium. We aim to determine conditions for maximum sustainable yield by optimizing cost per unit of fishing effort. Additionally, we explore conditions to prevent extinction and restore sustainable fishing. Marine protected areas (MPAs) can restore fish stocks by destabilizing the CE and maintaining a stable positive equilibrium. A model incorporating an MPA and fish movement is proposed, suggesting a small carrying capacity-to-surface area ratio in the fishing zone. Optimal total catch can be achieved by selecting the appropriate MPA surface area.",

    "Abstract": "We present a classic SEIR model taking into account the daily movements of individuals in different places. The model also takes into account partial confinement of individuals. This model is coupled with a model of protection against the epidemic by the use of masks. We are studying the effects of combined confinement and protection measures on the dynamics of the epidemic. We consider a constant proportion of asymptomatic people. We assume that symptomatic infected people may change their urban travel behavior due to the disease which causes them to travel less to places where they used to move and to stay at home more often. We present a sensitivity study with respect to the parameters. We show that the combination of the use of masks with almost complete release of confinement makes it possible to avoid the occurrence of a secondary peak of the epidemic. The model predicts that a total release of confinement can be successful for an epidemic of R= 2.5 if on average a proportion of 60 % of the population wears masks of 60 % efficacy. However, if 10 % of the population remains confined, the same goal can be achieved with a proportion of 80 % of the population wearing masks with efficacy of the order of 40 %.",

    "Abstract": "We propose a bio-economic model of a fishery describing the variations of the fish stock, the fishing effort and the price of the resource on the market supposed to depend on supply and demand. The originality of this model comes from taking into account the storage of part of the resource for a certain time before being put up for sale on the market. Taking into account the supposedly fast price dynamics compared to the other mechanisms involved and after integration of the stock equation, the system is reduced to a system of two delayed differential equations. The qualitative analysis of the model is carried out with the search for equilibrium points and the study of their stability. The study shows the existence of a catastrophic equilibrium corresponding to the extinction of the resource and one or two sustainable fishery equilibrium points that can coexist under certain conditions. The model shows that storing part of the resource makes it possible to avoid a catastrophic situation with the extinction of the fish stock and to stabilize the fishery in the long term. The study also shows that the price variation of the resource has a stabilizing effect by avoiding the appearance of periodic solutions associated with a stable limit cycle surrounding a sustainable fishery equilibrium point resulting from a Hopf bifurcation, which is contrary to the case without price variation where this is possible.",

Since then, it has progressed rapidly and the number of cases grow exponentially each day. In this article, we utilize SEIR modelling to forecast COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria under two scenarios by using the real-time data from March 01 to April 10, 2020. In the first scenario: no control measures are put into place, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Algeria is 2.1, the number of new cases in Algeria will peak from around late May to early June and up to 82% of the Algerian population will likely contract the coronavirus. In the second scenario, at a certain date T, drastic control measures are taken, people are being advised to self-isolate or to quarantine and will be able to leave their homes only if necessary. We use SEIR model with fast change between fully protected and risky states. We prove that the final size of the epidemic depends strongly on the cumulative number of cases at the date when we implement intervention and on the fraction of the population in confinement. Our analysis shows that the longer we wait, the worse the situation will be and this very quickly produces.",

We assume that the immigrant (non-locals) population has a carrying capacity that limits their numbers in the host country, and we study how they might contribute to the disease spread.

The aggregated model is obtained for total fish stock and fishing effort. This aggregated (reduced) model is analyzed analytically as well as numerically. Biological and bionomic equilibria of the system are obtained, and criteria for local stability or instability of the system are derived. The impact of levels of taxation T on the fish population and on the revenue earned by the fishery is investigated. An optimal harvesting policy is also discussed using the Pontryagin's maximum principle.

    "Title": "PREDATOR-PREY DYNAMICS WITH SEASONAL WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS",
    "Abstract": "Water level in rivers, lakes and reservoirs has great influence on the interactions between prey and predator fish. Indeed, the increase of the water volume hinders the capture of the prey by the predator. The same reasoning applies when there is a decrease in the volume of water, favoring the capture of the prey by the predator. In this paper, we consider a seasonally varying predator-prey model to study the influence of water-level variations on the interaction between two species of fishes in an artificial lake. A seasonal variation of the water-level is introduced in the predation rate taking into account two values, leading to a general switched system. Permanence, stability and existence of an invariant domain containing at least one periodic solution are established. Our theoretical results confirm the assumption that the water exerts a strong influence on the interaction between fishes.",

    "Title": "Existence and global asymptotic stability of positive almost periodic solution for a predator-prey system in an artificial lake",
    "Abstract": "A periodic predator-prey model has been introduced in [5] to study the effect of water level on persistence or extinction of fish populations living in an artificial lake. By using the continuation theorem of Mawhin's coincidence degree theory, the authors give sufficient conditions for the existence of at least one positive periodic solution. In this paper we study the problem in the general case. We begin by analyzing the invariance, permanence, non-persistence and the globally asymptotic stability for the system. Most interestingly, under additional conditions, we find that the periodic solution obtained in [5] is unique. Finally, in order to make the model system more realistic, we consider the special case when the periodicity in [5] is replaced by almost periodicity. We obtain conditions for existence, uniqueness and stability of a positive almost periodic solution. The methods used in this paper will be comparison theorems and Lyapunov functions. An example is employed to illustrate our result.",

    "Title": "A density-dependent model describing age-structured population dynamics using hawk-dove tactics",
    "Abstract": "In this paper we deal with a nonlinear two-timescale discrete population model that couples age-structured demography with individual competition for resources. Individuals are divided into juvenile and adult classes, and demography is described by means of a density-dependent Leslie matrix. Adults compete to access resources; every time two adults meet, they choose either being aggressive (hawk) or non-aggressive (dove) to get the best pay-off. Individual encounters occur much more frequently than demographic events, what yields that the model takes the form of a two-timescale system. Approximate aggregation methods allow us to reduce the system while preserving at the same time crucial asymptotic information for the whole population. In this way, we are able to describe the total population size as function of individual aggressiveness level and environmental richness. Model analysis shows a general trend with species that look for richer environment having smaller proportions of hawk individuals with larger costs. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The global asymptotic stability of positive interior equilibrium solution is established using suitable Lyapunov functional. We then examine possibilities of the existence of bionomic equilibrium.

A simplified network planning situation is analyzed to optimize the size and number of marine reserves. We consider a general 2L-patch model of harvesting population dynamics with continuous time. Fish movements between the sites, as well as vessel displacements between the fishing sites, are assumed to take place at a faster time scale than the variation of the stock and the change of the fleet size. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the dynamics of the total fish stock and the total fishing effort. This reduced model is used to determine the optimal size and number of a marine reserves in order to maximize the catch at equilibrium. We show that the optimal number that maximizes the total fish catch at equilibrium depend intricately on the size of the reserve: A small number of reserves is optimal when the size of the reserve is higher and inverse.",

The stock corresponds to a fish population moving between these zones, on which they are harvested by fishing eets. We consider a linear chain of identical fishing zones. Fish movements between the zones, as well as vessels displacements, are assumed to take place at a faster time scale than the variation of the stock and the change of the eet size. The vessels movements between the fishing areas are assumed to be stock dependent, i.e. the larger the stock density is in a zone the more vessels tends to remain in it. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the dynamics of the total harvested stock and the total fishing effort. Under some assumption, we obtain either a stable equilibrium or a stable limit cycle which involves large cyclic variations of the total fish stock and fishing effort. We show that there exists an optimal number of fishing zones that maximizes the total catch at equilibrium. We discuss the results in relation to fish aggregating devices (FADs) sheries.",

We assume that fishes remain on fishing habitats while the fishing vessels can move at a fast time scale to visit the different fishing sites. We use the existence of two time scales to reduce the dimension of the model: we build an aggregated model considering the habitat fish densities and the total fishing effort. We explore a regulation procedure, which imposes an average residence time in patches. Several equilibria exist, a Fishery Free Equilibria (FFEs) as well as a Sustainable Fishery Equilibria (SFEs). We show that the dynamics depends on a threshold which is similar to a basic reproduction ratio for the fishery. When the basic reproduction ratio is less or equal to 1, one of the FFEs is globally asymptotically stable (GAS), otherwise one of the SFEs is GAS. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "Title": "Effect of Hawk-Dove Game on the Dynamics of Two Competing Species",
    "Abstract": "Outcomes of interspecific competition, and especially the possibility of coexistence, have been extensively studied in theoretical ecology because of their implications in community assemblages. During the last decades, the influence of different time scales through the local/regional dynamics of animal communities has received an increasing attention. Nevertheless, different time scales involved in interspecific competition can result form other processes than spatial dynamics. Here, we envision and analyze a new theoretical framework that couples a game theory approach for competition with a demographic model. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the total densities of the two populations and we study how these two time scales interfere and influence outcomes of species competition. We find that a competition process occurring on a faster time scale than demography yields a \"priority effect\" where the first species introduced outcompetes the other one. We then confirm previous findings stipulating that species coexistence is favored by large difference in time scales because the extinction/recolonization process. Our results then highlight that an integration of demographic and competition time scales at both local and regional levels is mandatory to explain communities assemblages and should become a research priority. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

Marine reserves, areas in which fishing is restricted or prohibited, can offer opportunities for the recovery of exploited stock and fishery enhancement. This study examines the impact of the creation of marine protected areas, from both economic and biological perspectives. The consequences of reserve establishment on the long-run equilibrium fish biomass and fishery catch levels are evaluated. We include reserve size as control variable to maximize catch at equilibrium. A continuous time model is used to simulate the effects of reserve size on fishing catch. Fish movements between the sites is assumed to take place at a faster time scale than the variation of the stock and the change of the fleet size. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the dynamics of the total fish stock and the fishing effort.

    "Title": "Numerical Study of a Water Gas Shift Fixed Bed Reactor Operating at Low Pressures",
    "Abstract": "Today, hydrogen has become one of the most promising clean energy. Several processes allow obtaining hydrogen, among them there is the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction. On an industrial scale, WGS reaction takes place at high pressure [25–35 bar]. At high pressure, the cost of the process rises due to the energy consumed by compression, and the reduction in the lifetime of the equipment and the catalyst. At low pressures, catalyst lifetime can reach many years and the energy cost is reduced. It is for this reason that we are interested in modelling and simulation of a WGS converter operating at low pressures close to atmospheric pressure. In this work, a numerical study was conducted in order to determine the conditions allowing good rector operating at low pressure. A number of drawbacks of the process were identified. These drawbacks are essentially the non-negligible pressure drops and the strong intraparticle diffusion resistances. The prediction of the concentrations and the reaction rate within the pellet showed that the active zone of the pellet is located near the particle surface. It has also been shown that the resistances to interfacial mass and heat transfer are insignificant. The study of pressure effect showed that the pressure increase reduces the required catalyst mass to achieve equilibrium. Finally, this work revealed that the decrease in temperature and the increase in the concentrations of the reactants by increasing their fluxes, make it possible to increase the effectiveness factor of the catalyst and the conversion of carbon monoxide.",

At high pressure, the cost of the process rises due to the energy consumed by compression, and the reduction in the lifetime of the equipment and the catalyst. At low pressures, catalyst lifetime can reach many years and the energy cost is reduced. It is for this reason that we are interested in modelling and simulation of a WGS converter operating at low pressures close to atmospheric pressure. In this work, a numerical study was conducted in order to determine the conditions allowing good rector operating at low pressure. A number of drawbacks of the process were identified. These drawbacks are essentially the non-negligible pressure drops and the strong intraparticle diffusion resistances. The prediction of the concentrations and the reaction rate within the pellet showed that the active zone of the pellet is located near the particle surface. It has also been shown that the resistances to interfacial mass and heat transfer are insignificant. The study of pressure effect showed that the pressure increase reduces the required catalyst mass to achieve equilibrium. Finally, this work revealed that the decrease in temperature and the increase in the concentrations of the reactants by increasing their fluxes, make it possible to increase the effectiveness factor of the catalyst and the conversion of carbon monoxide.

    "Abstract": "The present study is avoided to a better understanding of the complexity of the adsorption process of a gaseous constituent on a porous solid (wood) with the purpose to improve the modeling. During the sorption on the porous solid, the diffusion mass transfer of the gaseous substance A occurs simultaneously in gaseous and adsorbed phases. The mass balance equations are written for the simultaneous diffusion transfers. The thermodynamic equilibrium between the phases is also represented. Four different models have been compared. Numerical results have been compared with experimental data and show that the hypothesis of equilibrium conditions between the gaseous and the adsorbed phases is not always verified.",

Students, on their part have become to expect a stimulating and simple learning experience which takes into consideration this quick pace and helps them solve the stereotypical problems of learning. The analyses conducted in this paper revealed that the recording of attendance in classrooms is done at the expense of the teaching-learning time. Therefore, the article at hand seeks to investigate an effective means to record attendance in a way which doesn't hinder learning. Differently put, the educational and administrative staffs need to find an effective way to record students' attendance at presential at the beginning of each learning session without affecting the time allotted to teaching and learning. This article presents and discusses the smart attendance monitoring system in smart classroom as a means to reduce the dropout rate, using connected objects and RFID technology. This system can facilitate the recording of students' attendance via the Internet of things (IoT) at presential while transmitting attendance record to the administration. At the same time, parents can keep track of their children's attendance to classes through a notification they receive via Email or SMS. In addition, the system automatically sends missed lessons to absent students.",

    "Abstract": "School guidance is declared an integral part of the education and training process, as it accompanies students in their educational and professional choices. Accordingly, the current situation in light of the Covid-19 epidemic requires a reconsideration of school guidance together with the methods of accompanying the student to choose the field that suits his/her personality, knowledge qualifications, perceptual and intellectual skills in order to achieve an excellent educational level that enables the learner to work in future professions. The current study aims to predict a student's potential and provide support for academic guidance. This paper emphasizes the importance of supervised machine learning and classification algorithms to predict the personality type based on student traits. Based on the information gathered, the results of this study indicate that it contributes significantly to providing a comprehensive approach to support academic self-orientation.",

    "Title": "Eye blinks artefacts detection in a single EEG channel",
    "Abstract": "In clinical conditions, the EEG measurements are mainly influenced by muscles and ocular movements, especially eye blinks. In this work, we present a new method to detect and reject eye blinks from a single-channel EEG signal. In an offline use mode, the proposed approach is based on statistical computations. It aims, in a first time, at estimating the pure EEG data interval. In a second time, we seek to improve the errors that may occur during the first step by using the Fisher-Snedecor test. By using ROC performance metrics, kappa coefficient and signal-to-artefact ratio (SAR), the proposed method is compared to an expert detection and to single-channel independent component analysis (SC-ICA), one of the widely used and robust methods for artefacts rejection. Experimental results show large values even when using the expert's annotation and the comparison to the SC-ICA method. This reflects the efficiency of the proposed method in detecting and rejecting blinks from a single-channel EEG signal.",

    "Title": "Use of cognitive load measurements to design a new architecture of intelligent learning systems",
    "Abstract": "In the context of learning environments, the learner's attention and mental effort are of primary interest in the process of acquiring knowledge. Due to the skills and abilities of each learner, there is a growing need for generic and adaptive environments. In this work, we introduce a new architecture for such environments to assist the learner with a multi-agent-based approach. Using Electroencephalogram, this architecture generates learning content and interactions adapted for each learner. Moreover, this work presents a new unsupervised approach to estimate and recognize the learner's cognitive load based on the Standardized Euclidean Distance (SED) and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of brain rhythms within low frequencies, namely Theta[4–7 Hz] (θ) and Alpha [8–11 Hz] (α). The learner's outcomes and estimated mental efforts are combined in the evaluation process using a fuzzy logic-based approach. Three experimental protocols are adopted in order to validate our study. These protocols are based on cognitive tasks with different difficulty levels. Experimental results show that PSD in θ and α bands in the occipital lobe accurately describe changes in the learner's mental efforts and cognitive load according to the cognitive task difficulty level. Based on the Cohen Kappa coefficient, our cognitive load estimation approach, using α, is compared to an existing cognitive load index from the literature. This performance assessment process revealed large values (k≥0.48) in the occipital lobe, which reflects the efficiency of the proposed approach. Results from this study are mainly used in educational engineering and reeducation in order to subjectively assess the approaches and treatments offered in these contexts.",

    "Title": "Brain-computer interface for workload estimation: Assessment of mental efforts in learning processes",
    "Abstract": "To assess the current mental state of an individual, several monitoring systems have been developed. In this paper, we explore the possibility to exploit information recorded noninvasively from the human cortex to develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) able to estimate brain workload and the mental efforts during a cognitive task. The EEG-based workload classifier presented in this paper combines a power spectral density (PSD) analysis and a statistical criterion. The proposed classifier is applied in the context of distance education and online course platform through two experimental protocols. The first one proposes solving a set of matrices products using pen and paper, while the second one proposes answering problems of logic mathematics on a computer-based learning environment. Experimental results show that the averaged accuracy of distinguishing changes in the theta [4–7 Hz] (θ) band is 79%. For the alpha band [8–11 Hz] (α) the averaged accuracy reached 78%. Based on this classifier, we demonstrate that θ and α powers in central, and posterior sites decrease with the increase in difficulty level of the cognitive task. The accuracy of correct decisions obtained from our results are significantly enhanced while comparing our investigation to some similar works from literature. In the realm of intelligent expert systems, our work results represent a first step to an implementation of an intelligent system for the evaluation of reeducative therapies to be used in physiotherapy centers for children with cognitive disorders as it is the case for Cerebral Palsy.",

Pre-tertiary school guidance is an indispensable aspect, since poor scholar guidance is always associated with failure at school. In the context of career paths, we propose an innovative approach, a solution to guide pre-tertiary students to choose the optimum vocational path. The purpose of the current study is to develop a school guidance system called “IoT-School Guidance”. The latter is supposed to create a smart and conducive environment for the successful adoption of school guidance using the Internet of things (IoT), given the fact that the IoT is the next revolutionary technology in the world where anything can transmit and receive information in real time.

In order to automatically detect and classify the road surface images, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used, as this model has proven to be more suitable for this task than traditional methods due to its ability to extract features implicitly. The novelty in this paper consists on finding the optimal CNN model architecture for crack detection and classification into 10 distinguished classes. The proposed CNN model is trained and tested using historical 3D pavement images and can perform the classification with a high accuracy (above 95%). To evaluate and supervise each road segment condition, a novel method for severity indexes computation that uses the resulting classes is suggested as well as the generation of a weighted road graph in which the edge weights evolve according to the severity indexes. All data processing tasks are performed over a Hadoop-based framework using HBase and MapReduce.",

    "Abstract": "Workflow adaptation is important for enterprises that are adjusting their functioning to deal with change; however, frequent adjustments to workflow are a costly and time-consuming process, which hinders the evolution of enterprise activities. Thus, there is a major need to enhance workflow flexibility and to automatize its adaptation to cope with these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for a self-adaptive workflow system. We propose an algorithm, which combines reinforcement learning and forecasting to enhance automatic workflow adaptation. The proposed solution integrates agents using Q-learning in a distributed way so as to determine the appropriate policy to adapt the workflow. It further applies auto-regressive integrated moving averages to predict changes in the workflow environment. For this purpose, we developed a collaborative multi-agent system to control these adaptations …",

    "Title": "An hybrid model of MCDA for the GIS: application to the localization of a site for the implantation of a dam.",
    "Abstract": "The choice of the localization of a urban infrastructure is a complex problem of the multicriterion decision aid (MCDA). To deal with this situation, several authors have demonstrated the interest of the association of the geographical information systems (GIS) and the MCDA. This association permits to manage the information of spatial reference, and at the same time to apply new methods of MCDA to select the best solutions. However, these analysis methods not only take into account the quantitative criteria, but also the qualitative and imprecise ones, linked to the environment, the regional development, and the socioeconomic impacts. To interpret these qualitative criteria correctly, it is necessary to represent them by precise values rather than by classic intervals. We propose in this paper, a hybrid model associating the multi-representation GIS (MRGIS), and the MCDA methods. Then, to facilitate the insertion of the qualitative criteria in our model, we propose an approach of data modelling based on the fuzzy logic, which allows us to represent all the information necessary to the decision making adequately. Finally, we will illustrate our subjects by an application of the localization of a site for the implantation of a dam.",

    "Title": "A multi-agent based social crm framework for extracting and analysing opinions",
    "Abstract": "Social media provide a wide space for people from around the world to communicate, share knowledge and personal experiences. They increasingly become an important data source for opinion mining and sentiment analysis, thanks to shared comments and reviews about products and services. And companies are showing a growing interest to harness their potential, in order to support setting up marketing strategies. Despite the importance of sentiment analysis in decision making, there is a lack of social intelligence integration at the level of customer relationship management systems. Thus, social customer relationship management (SCRM) systems have become an interesting research area. However, they need deep analytic techniques to transform the large amount of data “Big Data” into actionable insights. Such systems also require an advanced modelling and data processing methods, and must consider the emerging paradigm related to proactive systems. In this paper, we propose an agent based social framework that extracts and consolidates the reviews expressed via social media, in order to help enterprises know more about customers’ opinions toward a particular product or service. To illustrate our approach, we present the case study of Twitter reviews that we use to extract opinions and sentiment about a set of products using SentiGem API. Data extraction, analysis and storage are performed using a framework based on Hadoop MapReduce and HBase.",

    "Abstract": "To favor emergency vehicles, promote collective modes of transport in Moroccan cities, we propose in this paper a control system to manage traffic at signalized intersections with priority links in urban settings. This system combines multi-agent technology and fuzzy logic to regulate traffic flows. The traffic system flow is divided into two types of vehicles: priority and regular vehicles. The regular vehicles can use only the regular links, while the priority vehicles may use both priority and the regular links. This approach aims to favor emergency vehicles and promote collective modes of transport, it acts on the traffic light phases length and order to control all traffic flows. We proposed a decentralized system of regulation based on real-time monitoring to develop a local inter-section state, and intelligent coordination between neighboring intersections to build an overview of the traffic state. The regulation and prioritization decisions are made through cooperation, communication, and coordination between different agents. The performance of the proposed system is investigated and instantiated in ANYLOGIC simulator, using a section of the Marrakesh Road network that contains priority links. The results indicate that the designed system can significantly develop the efficiency of the traffic regulation system.",

The main difference is that our Multi-Agent System can perform the segmentation process ensuring efficiency. Our results show that the performance indices in the system were higher. Furthermore, the integration of thecooperation paradigm allows to speed up the segmentation process. Besides, the tests reveal the robustness of our method by proving competitive results.

    "Title": "A robust multi-agent negotiation for advanced image segmentation: design and implementation",
    "Abstract": "It is generally accepted that segmentation is a critical problem that influences subsequent tasks during image processing. Often, the proposed approaches provide effectiveness for a limited type of images with a significant lack of a global solution. The difficulty of segmentation lies in the complexity of providing a global solution with acceptable accuracy within a reasonable time. To overcome this problem, some solutions combined several methods. This paper presents a method for segmenting 2D/3D images by merging regions and solving problems encountered during the process using a multi-agent system (MAS). We are using the strengths of MAS by opting for a compromise that satisfies segmentation by agentsâ€™ acts. Regions with high similarity are merged immediately, while the others with low similarity are ignored. The remaining ones, with ambiguous similarity, are solved in a coalition by negotiation. In our system, the agents make decisions according to the utility functions adopting the Pareto optimal in Game theory. Unlike hierarchical merging methods, MAS performs a hypothetical merger planning then negotiates the agreements' subsets to merge all regions at once.",

    "Abstract": "Air pollution is considered a major health problem in urban areas. Small sensor technology integrated with smart phones can be widely used to collect air quality information in real time using mobile applications. By applying the concept of crowdsensing, citizens and authorities can be aware of exposure to pollution during their daily activities in urban areas. This paper describes an on-road air quality monitoring and control approach based on the crowdsensing paradigm. In addition to collecting air pollution data, we are exploring the possibility of using this technology to effectively detect critical situations and redistribute all information through a proactive decision support framework. This information can be combined with sensed air quality parameters for displaying, on an interactive map, the detected pollutants' concentrations using sensors attached to smart phones. The proposed framework provides users with real-time traffic and air quality information, traffic recommendations and notifications, and environmental conditions. Moreover, the authorities can use this system to improve urban mobility and traffic regulation. Such behavior and movements related to geographic information can provide a better understanding of the dynamics of a road network. In this work, we propose to combine the benefits of the crowdsensing paradigm with both machine learning and Big Data tools. An artificial neural networks model and the A* algorithm are used for air quality prediction and the least polluted path finding.

In addition, the evaluation process needs to be adapted on an ongoing basis to cope with emerging risk factors. Furthermore, high-risk container inspection is commonly hindered by a low inspection capacity, which leads to a major issue: how can we prioritize the container inspection if the number of suspect containers exceeds the inspection capacity? Container inspection prioritizing may be the answer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for adaptively prioritizing container inspection (APRICOIN). First, we enhance the container information flow to alleviate the problem of incomplete information by proposing an enhanced container descriptive. Second, we introduce the APRICOIN algorithm, which combines frequent pattern mining and a fuzzy logic system, to assess the container's risk …",

    "Abstract": "Driver decisions and behaviors are the major factors in on-road driving safety. Most significantly, traffic injuries and accidents are reduced using the accurate driver behavior monitoring system. However, the challenges occur in understanding human behaviors in the practical environment due to uncontrolled scenarios like cluttered and dynamic backgrounds, occlusion, and illumination variation. Recently, traffic accidents are mainly caused by distracted drivers, which has increased with the popularization of smartphones. Therefore, the distracted driver detection model is necessary to appropriately find the behavior of the distracted driver and give warnings to the driver to prevent accidents, which need to be concentrated as serious issues. The main intention of this paper is to design and implement a novel deep learning framework for driver distraction detection. First, the datasets for driver distraction detection are gathered from public sources. Furthermore, the Optimal Fusion-based Local Gradient Pattern (LGP) and Local Weber Pattern (LWP) perform the pattern extraction of the images. These patterns are inputted into the new deep learning framework with Ensemble Variant Convolutional Neural Network (EV-CNN) for feature learning. The EV-CNN includes three different models, like Resnet50, Inceptionv3, and Xception. The extracted features are subjected to the architecture-optimized Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The Hybrid Squirrel Whale Optimization Algorithm (HSWOA) performs both the pattern extraction and the LSTM optimization.

    "Abstract": "In the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITs), traffic congestion is considered as an important problem. Traffic blockage usually affects the quality of time, travel time, economy of the country, and transportability of people. The information of traffic congestion is collected and analyzed in ITs, and the methods to prevent the traffic congestion are predicted. However, the tackling of huge data is still challenging. The rapid increase in vehicle usage and road construction has resulted in traffic congestion. Various studies are undergone in ITs to recognize the traffic management system by adopting few resources. Real time-based traffic services are implemented to prevent the traffic congestion in existing areas. These services provide high expense accuracy. This paper plans to develop a new technique to predict the traffic congestion using improved deep learning approaches. At first, the benchmark dataset is gathered and the pre-processing of data is performed with removing the bad data, organizing the raw data, and filling the null values. The optimized weighted features are selected from the pre-processed data by adopting a new meta-heuristic Hybrid Jaya Harris Hawk Optimization (HJHHO) algorithm. The prediction of congestion parameters such as speed reduction rate, very low speed rate, and volume to capacity ratio of vehicles are performed by the proposed Improved Deformable Convolutional Recurrent Network (IDCRN) prediction model. These predicted measures are subjected to fuzzy interference system for congestion index computation. From the experimental analysis, it has proved that the proposed method has reduced the …",

    "Title": "ARP-PROBE: An ARP spoofing detector for Internet of Things networks using explainable deep learning",
    "Abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and application domains has made IoT security an unavoidable challenge. Spoofing the address resolution protocol (ARP) can be exploited by botnets and other malicious programs to propagate and cause damage. Conventional ARP spoofing detection and prevention methods are, in most cases, inefficient for the IoT. This paper presents an ARP spoofing detection system using explainable deep learning, namely ARP-PROBE, for IoT networks. The proposed system relies on features extracted from network packets to detect ARP spoofing quickly and effectively using a feature selection and extraction module that identifies and selects the highly influential features. In a performance evaluation, the proposed system achieved an accuracy of 99.98% and an F1 score of 0.999. ARP-PROBE had a false positive rate of 0.026% and a false negative rate of 0.001%. To ensure that the model generalizes beyond the training data, a second dataset was used to evaluate it, and the results obtained were consistent with those of the first dataset. To provide a better understanding of the impact of each feature on the performance of the proposed deep learning model, which is the core of ARP-PROBE, a model explanation using SHAP explainability was provided.",

    "Title": "Context-Driven Service Deployment Using Likelihood-Based Approach for Internet of Things Scenarios",
    "Abstract": "In a context-aware Internet of Things (IoT) environment, the functional contexts of devices and users will change over time depending on their service consumption. Each iteration of an IoT middleware algorithm will also encounter changes occurring in the contexts due to the joining/leaving of new/old members; this is the inherent nature of ad hoc IoT scenarios. Individual users will have notable preferences in their service consumption patterns; by leveraging these patterns, the approach presented in this article focuses on how these changes impact performance due to functional-context switching over time. This is based on the idea that consumption patterns will exhibit certain time-variant correlations. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used in the proposed approach to capture the impact of these correlations and study them in depth. The results of this study reveal how the correlation probabilities and the system performance change over time; this also aids with the construction of the boundaries of certain time-variant correlations in users’ consumption patterns. In the proposed approach, the information gleaned from the MLE is used in arranging the service information within a distributed service registry based on users’ service usage preferences. Practical simulations were conducted over small (100 nodes), medium (1000 nodes), and relatively larger (10,000 nodes) networks. It was found that the approach described helps to reduce service discovery time and can improve the performance in service-oriented IoT scenarios.",

    "Title": "When Security Risk Assessment Meets Advanced Metering Infrastructure: Identifying the Appropriate Method",
    "Abstract": "Leading risk assessment standards such as the NIST SP 800-39 and ISO 27005 state that information security risk assessment (ISRA) is one of the crucial stages in the risk-management process. It pinpoints current weaknesses and potential risks, the likelihood of their materializing, and their potential impact on the functionality of critical information systems such as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). If the current security controls are insufficient, risk assessment helps with applying countermeasures and choosing risk-mitigation strategies to decrease the risk to a controllable level. Although studies have been conducted on risk assessment for AMI and smart grids, the scientific foundations for selecting and using an appropriate method are lacking, negatively impacting the credibility of the results. The main contribution of this work is identifying an appropriate ISRA method for AMI by aligning the risk assessment criteria for AMI systems with the ISRA methodologies’ characteristics. Consequently, this work makes three main contributions. First, it presents a comprehensive comparison of multiple ISRA methods, including OCTAVE Allegro (OA), CORAS, COBRA, and FAIR, based on a variety of input requirements, tool features, and the type of risk assessment method. Second, it explores the necessary conditions for carrying out a risk assessment for an AMI system. Third, these AMI risk assessment prerequisites are aligned with the capabilities of multiple ISRA approaches to identify the best ISRA method for AMI systems. The OA method is found to be the best-suited risk assessment method for AMI, and this outcome paves the way to standardizing this method for AMI risk assessment.",

    "Abstract": "In an ideal world, how individuals learn should align with the methods they are taught. However, this is not always the case, and it is necessary to reconsider the approach to teaching in academic institutions, such as universities, to help students learn at their own pace. Innovative technology plays a vital role in achieving this objective. This study proposes using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to teach in academic institutions. Specifically, an AI-powered conversational bot called Conversational AI Bot for Efficient Learning (COFFEE) is designed, implemented, and will be used as an adaptive learning technology. COFFEE will analyze students' learning habits and adjust the teaching style based on their strengths and weaknesses. Teaching and learning are closely linked to the disciplinary areas of education, behavior, and technology. Combining these areas into a conversational bot equipped with AI algorithms and access to big data makes it possible to disrupt traditional teaching methods. This will benefit students who require special attention, such as those with severe learning disabilities who cannot receive adequate support from instructors due to time constraints or lack of experience. COFFEE is a valuable tool that can be used in academic institutions at all levels, including primary and secondary education. It will be based on the latest advancements in AI and data science and is designed to be feasible, reliable, and customizable.",

    "Title": "Automatic brain-tumor diagnosis using cascaded deep convolutional neural networks with symmetric U-Net and asymmetric residual-blocks",
    "Abstract": "The use of various kinds of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for examining brain tissue has increased significantly in recent years, and manual investigation of each of the resulting images can be a time-consuming task. This paper presents an automatic brain-tumor diagnosis system that uses a CNN for detection, classification, and segmentation of glioblastomas; the latter stage seeks to segment tumors inside glioma MRI images. The structure of the developed multi-unit system consists of two stages. The first stage is responsible for tumor detection and classification by categorizing brain MRI images into normal, high-grade glioma (glioblastoma), and low-grade glioma. The uniqueness of the proposed network lies in its use of different levels of features, including local and global paths. The second stage is responsible for tumor segmentation, and skip connections and residual units are used during this step. Using 1800 images extracted from the BraTS 2017 dataset, the detection and classification stage was found to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99%. The segmentation stage was then evaluated using the Dice score, specificity, and sensitivity. The results showed that the suggested deep-learning-based system ranks highest among a variety of different strategies reported in the literature.",

    "Title": "Automatic mapping of configuration options in software using static analysis",
    "Abstract": "Configuration errors are some of the main reasons for software failures. Some configuration options may even negatively impact the software's security, so that if a user sets the options inappropriately, there may be a huge security risk for the software. Recent studies have proposed mapping option read points to configuration options as the first step in alleviating the occurrence of configuration errors. Sadly, most available techniques use humans, and the rest require additional input, like an operation manual. Unfortunately, not all software is standardized and friendly. We propose a technique based on program and static analysis that can automatically map all the configuration options of a program just by reading the source code. Our evaluation shows that this technique achieves 88.6%, 97.7%, 94.6%, 94.8%, and 92.6% success rates with the Hadoop modules Common, Hadoop distributed file system, MapReduce, and YARN, and also PX4, when extracting configuration options. We found 53 configuration options in PX4 that were not documented and submitted these to the developers. Compared with published work, our technique is more effective in mapping options, and it may lay the foundation for subsequent research on software configuration security.",

    "Title": "A Novel Image Steganography Method for Industrial Internet of Things Security",
    "Abstract": "The rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) brings new security threats by exposing secret and private data. Thus, information security has become a major concern in the communication environment of IIoT and AI, where security and privacy must be ensured for the messages between a sender and the intended recipient. In this article, we propose a method called Harris hawks optimization-integer wavelet transform (HHO-IWT) for covert communication and secure data in the IIoT environment based on digital image steganography. The method embeds secret data in the cover images using a metaheuristic optimization algorithm called HHO to efficiently select image pixels that can be used to hide bits of secret data within integer wavelet transforms. The HHO-based pixel selection operation uses an objective function evaluation depending on the following two phases: exploitation and exploration. The objective function is employed to determine an optimal encoding vector to transform secret data into an encoded form generated by the HHO algorithm. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method with respect to visual quality, payload capacity, and security against attacks. The obtained results reveal that the HHO-IWT method achieves higher levels of security than the state-of-the-art methods and that it resists various forms of steganalysis. Thus, utilizing this approach can keep unauthorized individuals away from the transmitted information and solve some security challenges in the IIoT.",

    "Title": "An adaptive image steganography method based on histogram of oriented gradient and PVD-LSB techniques",
    "Abstract": "Pixel value differencing (PVD) and least significant bit substitution (LSB) are two widely used schemes in image steganography. These two methods do not consider different content in a cover image for hiding the secret data. The content of most digital images has different edge directions in each pixel, and the local object shape or appearance is mostly characterized by the distribution of its intensity gradients or edge directions. Exploiting these characteristics for embedding various secret information in different edge directions will eliminate sequential embedding and improve robustness. Thus, a histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) algorithm is proposed to find the dominant edge direction for each 2×2 block of cover images. Blocks of interest (BOIs) are determined adaptively based on the gradient magnitude and angle of the cover image. Then, the PVD algorithm is used to hide secret data in the dominant edge direction, while the LSB substitution is utilized in the other two remaining pixels. Extensive experiments using various standard images reveal that the proposed scheme provides high embedding capacity and better visual quality compared with several other PVD- and LSB-based methods. Moreover, it resists various steganalysis techniques, such as pixel difference histogram and RS analysis.",

    "Abstract": "Cattle, buffalo and cow identification plays an influential role in cattle traceability from birth to slaughter, understanding disease trajectories and large-scale cattle ownership management. Muzzle print images are considered discriminating cattle biometric identifiers for biometric-based cattle identification and traceability. This paper presents an exploration of the performance of the bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) approach in cattle identification using local invariant features extracted from a database of muzzle print images. Two local invariant feature detectors-namely, speeded-up robust features (SURF) and maximally stable extremal regions (MSER)-are used as feature extraction engines in the BoVW model. The performance evaluation criteria include several factors, namely, the identification accuracy, processing time and the number of features. The experimental work measures the performance of the BoVW model under a variable number of input muzzle print images in the training, validation, and testing phases. The identification accuracy values when utilizing the SURF feature detector and descriptor were 75%, 83%, 91%, and 93% for when 30%, 45%, 60%, and 75% of the database was used in the training phase, respectively. However, using MSER as a points-of-interest detector combined with the SURF descriptor achieved accuracies of 52%, 60%, 67%, and 67%, respectively, when applying the same training sizes. The research findings have proven the feasibility of deploying the BoVW paradigm in cattle identification using local invariant features extracted from muzzle print images.",

    "Title": "LETM-IoT: A lightweight and efficient trust mechanism for Sybil attacks in Internet of Things networks",
    "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently gained significance as a means of connecting various physical devices to the Internet, enabling various innovative applications. However, the security of IoT networks is a significant concern due to the large volume of data generated and transmitted over them. The limited resources of IoT devices, along with their mobility and diverse characteristics, pose significant challenges for maintaining security in routing protocols, such as the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). This lacks effective defense mechanisms against routing attacks, including Sybil and rank attacks. Various techniques have been proposed to address this issue, including cryptography and intrusion-detection systems. The use of these techniques on IoT nodes is limited by their low power and lossy nature, primarily due to the significant computational overhead they involve. In addition, conventional trust-management systems for addressing security concerns need to be improved due to their high computation, memory, and energy costs. Therefore, this paper presents a novel, Lightweight, and Efficient Trust-based Mechanism (LETM-IoT) for resource-limited IoT networks to mitigate Sybil attacks. We conducted extensive simulations in Cooja, the Contiki OS simulator, to assess the efficacy of the proposed LETM-IoT against three types of Sybil attack (A, B, and C). A comparison was also made with standard RPL and state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental findings show that LETM-IoT outperforms both of these in terms of average packet-delivery ratio by 0.20 percentage points, true-positive ratio by 1.34 percentage points, energy consumption by 2.5%, and memory utilization by 19.42%. The obtained results also show that LETM-IoT consumes increased storage by 5.02% compared to the standard RPL due to the existence of an embedded security module.",

In phishing, attackers craft malicious websites disguised as well-known, legitimate sites and send them to individuals to steal personal information and other related private details. Therefore, an efficient and accurate method is required to determine whether a website is malicious. Numerous methods have been proposed for detecting malicious uniform resource locators (URLs) using deep learning, machine learning, and other approaches. In this study, we have used malicious and benign URLs datasets and have proposed a detection mechanism for detecting malicious URLs using recurrent neural network models such as long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). Experimental results have shown that the proposed mechanism achieved an accuracy of 97.0% for LSTM, 99.0% for Bi-LSTM, and 97.5% for GRU, respectively.",

    "Title": "Reinforcement-Learning-Based Intrusion Detection in Communication Networks: A Review",
    "Abstract": "Modern communication networks have to meet the performance requirements of contemporary industrial control systems (ICSs), which are increasingly being connected to the external Internet. This connectivity exposes them to vulnerabilities that necessitate timely and effective protection measures. The integration of intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) into communication networks serves as a preventive mechanism to defend against malicious threats and hostile activities, ensuring secure operations within the broader industrial infrastructure. This review explores the cutting-edge artificial-intelligence techniques that are employed in the development of IDSs for diverse industrial control networks, emphasizing the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) within IDS-based systems across various communication networks. DRL has been successful in solving complex sequential decision-making problems in various domains, including robotics, game playing, and natural-language processing. The review examines a broad scope of publications, and these are categorized into three groups: DRL-only and IDS-only in the introduction and background, and DRL-based IDS papers in the core section of the review. This seeks to provide researchers with an overview of the current state of DRL approaches in IDSs for various network types. Through a meticulous comparative analysis with existing surveys, our review stands out, emphasizing its uniqueness and comprehensiveness. This inclusivity extends beyond traditional boundaries, encompassing a wide array of IDS techniques and environments, ranging from the Internet of Things to ICSs, smart grids, and other domains. Additionally, this review provides useful information such as the datasets used, types of DRL employed, pretrained networks, IDS techniques, evaluation metrics, and improvements gained. Furthermore, the algorithms and methods used in several studies are presented to illustrate the principles of each DRL-based IDS subcategory clearly and in depth. A detailed taxonomy is presented, providing nuanced insights into diverse applications with a triple focus on IDSs, deep-learning, and DRL techniques, which makes this review unique.",

    "Abstract": "One of the crucial components of a smart grid is the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), which integrates information and communication technologies with a conventional electricity grid. Due to the importance of an AMI system and the vital data that it stores, an information security risk assessment (ISRA) process must be carried out to identify potential risks before applying any security measures. This study contributes to AMI security by assessing the potential security risks using the OCTAVE Allegro (OA) approach. OA is selected as an appropriate approach based on a comparative study of ISRA methods. The comparison process aligns the AMI requirements with the capabilities of the ISRA methods. To analyze any potential security risks, an AMI system is evaluated through the eight steps of the OA methodology. Through the OA implementation, eleven risk scenarios are identified that affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an AMI system. For completeness, the study recommends risk mitigation approaches to limit the identified risks associated with an AMI system.",

    "Abstract": "The current ubiquity of online social networks (OSNs) cannot be overstated, and they have over 4.8 billion users worldwide. These platforms have become integrated into modern life, representing an important means of communication and information sharing. However, this widespread popularity has also drawn the attention of cybercriminals, who seek to exploit OSNs using deceptive Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) as their weapons of choice. Conventional URL-classification methods, which rely on post-access features or static analysis, face significant limitations; they struggle to keep pace with the ever-evolving tactics of cybercriminals, and they often lack the granularity required for precise URL categorization. The methodology proposed herein takes a different path, leveraging the power of an artificial neural network (ANN) in tandem with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to extract contextual embeddings from URLs. By combining the cutting-edge capabilities of ANNs and BERT, we introduce an efficient approach to safeguarding OSN users from the insidious threats lurking behind deceptive URLs by classifying them into five distinct categories: benign, defacement, phishing, malware, and spam. The proposed approach was found to achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 98.0%, surpassing the previous best of 97.92%. This technique thus has the potential to serve as a crucial defense mechanism for the billions of individuals who rely on OSNs for their social and informational needs.",

    "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an enabler paradigm for different applications, such as healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and recently, enterprise systems. Significant advances in IoT networks have been hindered by security vulnerabilities and threats, which, if not addressed, can negatively impact the deployment and operation of IoT-enabled systems. This article addresses IoT security and presents an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. The system's intelligence is driven by machine learning techniques for intrusion detection, with the two-layer architecture handling flow-based and packet-based features. By selecting significant features, the time overhead is minimized without affecting detection accuracy. The uniqueness and novelty of the proposed system emerge from combining machine learning and selection modules for flow-based and packet-based features. The proposed intrusion detection works at the network layer, and hence, it is device and application transparent. In our experiments, the proposed system had an accuracy of 99.15% for packet-based features with a testing time of 0.357 μs. The flow-based classifier had an accuracy of 99.66% with a testing time of 0.410 μs. A comparison demonstrated that the proposed system outperformed other methods described in the literature. Thus, it is an accurate and lightweight tool for detecting intrusions in IoT systems.",

By analogy to vetting mobile apps, this paper addresses the lack of principles and techniques for vetting IoT devices (things) in preparation for their integration into mission-critical systems. Things have got vulnerabilities that should be discovered and assessed through proper device vetting. Unfortunately, this is not happening. Rather than sensing a nuclear turbines steam level, a thing could collect some sensitive data about the turbine without the knowledge of users and leak these data to third parties. This paper presents a guiding framework that defines the concepts of, principles of, and techniques for thing vetting as a pro-active response to potential things vulnerabilities.",

Adware is a form of malware that downloads and displays unwanted advertisements, which are often offensive and always unsolicited. This paper presents a machine learning-based system (AdStop) that detects Android adware by examining the features in the flow of network traffic. The design goals of AdStop are high accuracy, high speed, and good generalizability beyond the training dataset. A feature reduction stage was implemented to increase the accuracy of Adware detection and reduce the time overhead. The number of relevant features used in training was reduced from 79 to 13 to improve the efficiency and simplify the deployment of AdStop. In experiments, the tool had an accuracy of 98.02% with a false positive rate of 2% and a false negative rate of 1.9%. The time overhead was 5.54 s for training and 9.36 µs for a single instance in the testing phase. In tests, AdStop outperformed other methods described in the literature. It is an accurate and lightweight tool for detecting mobile adware.",

    "Title": "Efficient Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Using System Calls",
    "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has shown rapid growth and wide adoption in recent years. However, IoT devices are not designed to address modern security challenges. The weak security of these devices has been exploited by malicious actors and has led to several serious cyber-attacks. In this context, anomaly detection approaches are considered very effective owing to their ability to detect existing and novel attacks while requiring data only from normal execution. Because of the limited resources of IoT devices, conventional security solutions are not feasible. This emphasizes the need to develop new approaches that are specifically tailored to IoT devices. In this study, we propose a host-based anomaly detection approach that uses system call data and a Markov chain to represent normal behavior. This approach addresses the challenges that existing approaches face in this area, mainly the segmentation of the syscall trace into suitable smaller units and the use of a fixed threshold to differentiate between normal and malicious syscall sequences. Our proposed approach provides a mechanism for segmenting syscall traces into the program’s execution paths and dynamically determines the threshold for anomaly detection. The proposed approach was evaluated against various attacks using two well-known public datasets provided by the University of New South Mexico (UNM) and one custom dataset (PiData) developed in the laboratory. We also compared the performance and characteristics of our proposed approach with those of recently published related work. The proposed approach has a very low false positive rate (0.86%), high (Formula presented.) (100%), and a high (Formula presented.) score (100%) that is, a combined performance measure of (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.).",

    "Title": "Multi-Mobile Agent Trust Framework for Mitigating Internal Attacks and Augmenting RPL Security",
    "Abstract": "Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as an important way to connect diverse physical devices to the internet. The IoT paves the way for a slew of new cutting-edge applications. Despite the prospective benefits and many security solutions offered in the literature, the security of IoT networks remains a critical concern, considering the massive amount of data generated and transmitted. The resource-constrained, mobile, and heterogeneous nature of the IoT makes it increasingly challenging to preserve security in routing protocols, such as the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL). RPL does not offer good protection against routing attacks, such as rank, Sybil, and sinkhole attacks. Therefore, to augment the security of RPL, this article proposes the energy-efficient multi-mobile agent-based trust framework for RPL (MMTM-RPL). The goal of MMTM-RPL is to mitigate internal attacks in IoT-based wireless sensor networks using fog layer capabilities. MMTM-RPL mitigates rank, Sybil, and sinkhole attacks while minimizing energy and message overheads by 25–30% due to the use of mobile agents and dynamic itineraries. MMTM-RPL enhances the security of RPL and improves network lifetime (by 25–30% or more) and the detection rate (by 10% or more) compared to state-of-the-art approaches, namely, DCTM-RPL, RBAM-IoT, RPL-MRC, and DSH-RPL.",

    "Title": "Urban Transition in the Era of the Internet of Things: Social Implications and Privacy Challenges",
    "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) could become an important aspect of urban life in the next decade. In the IoT paradigm, various information and communication technologies (ICTs) are used in concert to substantially reduce urban problems. Smart cities and ubiquitous cities will adopt ICTs in the urban development process; however, IoT-based cities will experience considerably stronger effects than those that adopt conventional ICTs. IoT cities allow urban residents and \"things\" to be connected to the Internet by virtue of the extension of the Internet Protocol from IPv4 to IPv6 and of cutting-edge device and sensor technology. Therefore, the urban transition resulting from the influence of IoT may be a critical issue. The privacy-related vulnerabilities of IoT technologies may negatively affect city residents. Furthermore, disparities in the spread of IoT systems across different countries may allow some countries to subvert the privacy of other countries' citizens. The aim of this paper is to identify the potential prospects and privacy challenges that will emerge from IoT deployment in urban environments. This paper reviews the prospects of and barriers to IoT implementation at the regional, city, and residential scales from the perspectives of security and privacy. The IoT technology will be a continual presence in life in general and in urban life in particular. However, the adoption of the IoT paradigm in cities will be complicated due to the inherent presence of unsecured connections. Moreover, the IoT systems may rob people of some of their humanity, infringing on their privacy, because people are also regarded as \"things\" in the IoT paradigm. Given the social trepidation surrounding IoT implementation, local and international associations related to IoT privacy, and legislation and international laws, are needed to maintain the personal right to privacy and to satisfy the demands of institutional privacy in urban contexts.",

    "Title": "Security risk assessment within hybrid data centers: A case study of delay sensitive applications",
    "Abstract": "Data centers are considered a critical form of infrastructure in today's information society. They are at the core of the cloud computing and services revolution, which has changed the business models on how organizations deal with IT infrastructure costs. The hybrid data center architecture incorporates both legacy and fully virtualized infrastructures. On the one hand, the composite infrastructure has improved resource utilization and consolidation by adding flexibility and scalability factors, making the data center more cost effective and more agile. On the other hand, the hybrid infrastructure has imposed a new set of security challenges that need to be brought into focus. The lack of resource availability can be a great risk for delay sensitive applications such as voice over IP (VoIP) and online gaming when cloud computing is the deployment model. This study addresses the emerging risk problem by conducting a comprehensive security risk assessment using the NIST national vulnerability database (NVD) combined with EBIOS risk analysis and evaluation methodology. This study focuses on resource availability problem emanating from delay variations and queuing mechanisms in virtualized systems and its impact on delay sensitive applications. The study argues for the existence of availability risk within the hybrid data center infrastructure, which can deteriorate the performance of delay sensitive applications. Security remedial and countermeasures to the identified security risks are suggested in an extended discussion at the end of the study.",

    "Title": "DivaCAN: Detecting in-vehicle intrusion attacks on a controller area network using ensemble learning",
    "Abstract": "The controller area network (CAN) protocol is a critical communication mechanism in vehicular systems. However, the widespread adoption of this protocol has introduced vulnerabilities to in-vehicle communication channels, making them susceptible to various security threats, including denial-of-service, fuzzy, and impersonation attacks. There is thus an urgent need to develop effective security measures to counter these threats. Unfortunately, existing approaches to attack detection suffer from shortcomings such as suboptimal accuracy and high false-positive rates. Herein, we propose a novel methodology to address these limitations, DivaCAN. DivaCAN leverages an ensemble of classifiers, including deep neural networks, the multi-layer perceptron, the light gradient-boosting machine, extra trees, random forest, and Bagging, along with k-nearest neighbors, for intrusion-attack recognition on the CAN bus. The DivaCAN model was thoroughly evaluated, and its exceptional performance, which surpasses that of the latest methodologies, was demonstrated. It was found to achieve a precision of 94.93%, a recall of 94.98%, and an F1 score of 94.97%. One notable aspect of this research is the emphasis on achieving a low false-positive rate, which is often overlooked by other methodologies. Additionally, the DivaCAN model was found to exhibit an acceptable execution time of 406 s, highlighting the importance of considering both accuracy and efficiency when evaluating the performance of classification models. This study thus significantly enhances the security of in-vehicle communication on the CAN protocol. DivaCAN is a robust and accurate intrusion-detection system that addresses the pressing need for effective security measures in vehicular systems.",

    "Title": "Two-phase multi-model automatic brain tumour diagnosis system from magnetic resonance images using convolutional neural networks",
    "Abstract": "Brain tumour is a serious disease, and the number of people who are dying due to brain tumours is increasing. Manual tumour diagnosis from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a time consuming process and is insufficient for accurately detecting, localizing, and classifying the tumour type. This research proposes a novel two-phase multi-model automatic diagnosis system for brain tumour detection and localization. In the first phase, the system structure consists of preprocessing, feature extraction using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and feature classification using the error-correcting output codes support vector machine (ECOC-SVM) approach. The purpose of the first system phase is to detect brain tumour by classifying the MRIs into normal and abnormal images. The aim of the second system phase is to localize the tumour within the abnormal MRIs using a fully designed five-layer region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN). The performance of the first phase was assessed using three CNN models, namely, AlexNet, Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16, and VGG-19, and a maximum detection accuracy of 99.55% was achieved with AlexNet using 349 images extracted from the standard Reference Image Database to Evaluate Response (RIDER) Neuro MRI database. The brain tumour localization phase was evaluated using 804 3D MRIs from the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2013 database, and a DICE score of 0.87 was achieved. The empirical work proved the outstanding performance of the proposed deep learning-based system in tumour detection compared to other non-deep-learning approaches in the literature. The obtained results also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system concerning both tumour detection and localization.",

There are two type of features that can be extracted from an image content; namely global and local features. Global features describe the image as a whole and can be interpreted as a particular property of the image involving all pixels; while, the local features aim to detect keypoints within the image and describe regions around these keypoints. After extracting the features and their descriptors from images, matching of common structures between images (i.e., features matching) is the next step for these applications.

    "Title": "Impact of some biometric modalities on forensic science",
    "Abstract": "Recently, forensic science has had many challenges in many different types of crimes and crime scenes, vary from physical crimes to cyber or computer crimes. Accurate and efficient human identification or recognition have become crucial for forensic applications due to the large diversity of crime scenes, and because of the increasing need to accurately identify criminals from the available crime evidences. Biometrics is an emerging technology that provides accurate and highly secure personal identification and verification systems for civilian and forensic applications. The positive impact of biometric modalities on forensic science began with the rapid developments in computer science, computational intelligence, and computing approaches. These advancements have been reflected in the biometric modality capturing process, feature extraction, feature robustness, and features matching. A complete and automatic biometric identification or recognition systems have been built accordingly. This chapter presents a study of the impacts of using some biometric modalities in forensic applications. Although biometrics identification replaces human work with computerized and automatic systems in order to achieve better performance, new challenges have arisen. These challenges lie in biometric system reliability and accuracy, system response time, data mining and classification, and protecting user privacy. This chapter sheds light on the positive and the negative impacts of using some biometric modalities in forensic science. In particular, the impacts of fingerprint image, facial image, and iris patterns are considered. The selected modalities are covered preliminarily before tackling their impact on forensic applications. Furthermore, an extensive look at the future of biometric modalities deployment in forensic applications is covered as the last part of the chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",

    "Title": "Toward online education for fingerprint recognition: A proof-of-concept web platform",
    "Abstract": "Recent advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have pushed education systems into the online paradigm. Although fingerprint recognition has received considerable attention from researchers, the concept of creating online or distance education systems for fingerprint recognition systems is a valid problem that requires further investigation. This article addresses the problem and presents a web platform for online education of a fingerprint recognition system. This study focused on the technical design and implementation of the web platform solely as a proof of concept to illustrate the possibility of creating distance education for fingerprint recognition. The developed platform offers students a way to gain knowledge about the full range of fingerprint recognition system technology. The significance of using a web platform stems from the need to supplement students’ theoretical knowledge with practical hands-on experience with information security in general and with fingerprint recognition in particular. Demonstrations such as fingerprint image enhancement and fingerprint feature extraction are included in the current platform prototype. Plots of fingerprint recognition performance curves such as false match rate (FMR) and false non-match rate (FNMR) as functions of the matching threshold curve, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the detection error trade-off (DET) curve are plotted as part of the platform. From a technical viewpoint, the platform was successfully implemented; however, its educational impact needs further evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm focusing on the connection of devices, objects, or “things” to each other, to the Internet, and to users. IoT technology is anticipated to become an essential requirement in the development of smart homes, as it offers convenience and efficiency to home residents so that they can achieve better quality of life. Application of the IoT model to smart homes, by connecting objects to the Internet, poses new security and privacy challenges in terms of the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the data sensed, collected, and exchanged by the IoT objects. These challenges make smart homes extremely vulnerable to different types of security attacks, resulting in IoT-based smart homes being insecure. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the possible security risks to develop a complete picture of the security status of smart homes. This article applies the operationally critical threat, asset, and vulnerability evaluation (OCTAVE) methodology, known as OCTAVE Allegro, to assess the security risks of smart homes. The OCTAVE Allegro method focuses on information assets and considers different information containers such as databases, physical papers, and humans. The key goals of this study are to highlight the various security vulnerabilities of IoT-based smart homes, to present the risks on home inhabitants, and to propose approaches to mitigating the identified risks. The research findings can be used as a foundation for improving the security requirements of IoT-based smart homes.",

    "Title": "Towards smooth organisational adoption of cloud computing - A customer-provider security adaptation",
    "Abstract": "Cloud computing is daily becoming more and more accepted as a promising computing paradigm. For some years now, cloud computing has been in common use for such applications as Google apps (email, documents, etc), MSN Messenger (instant messaging), Skype (voice communications), and Flickr (image sharing). The idea of offering cloud computing facilities as a public utility began as early as the 1960s with John McCarthy.1-4Organisations and universities offered distributed computing starting in the late 1970s through dial-up access.5Grid computing was introduced in the early 1990s with the idea of providing access to shared computing power similar to the way electricity is shared through the electric power grid. In addition, open source platforms were first introduced by Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, and Nimbus for deploying private and hybrid clouds.6-8Although cloud computing has been available for some time, there is still some organisational resistance to its adoption, not least because of security concerns. Bilal Charif, of Luleå University of Technology, Sweden and Ali Ismail Awad of Luleå University and Al Azhar University, Egypt show that a number of organisations have no internal security responsibilities, nor do they have proper information security policies such as business and disaster recovery plans, all of which makes cloud adoption difficult. In contrast, cloud computing offers recovery plans for small and medium-sized organisations that will often otherwise not be implemented.",

Although solutions to secure IoT systems exist, Class-0 IoT devices with insufficient resources to support such solutions are considered a resourceconstrained in terms of secure communication. This paper provides a distributed security mechanism that targets Class-0 IoT devices. The research goal is to secure the entire data path in two segments, deviceto- gateway and gateway-to-server data communications. The main concern in the provided solution is that lighter security operations with minimal resource requirements are performed in the IoT device, while heavier tasks are performed in the gateway side. The proposed mechanism utilizes a symmetric encryption for data objects combined with the native wireless security to offer a layered security technique between the device and the gateway. In the offered solution, the IoT gateways provide additional protection by securing data using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Real-time experimental evaluations have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed mechanism pertaining to the security assurance and the consumed resources of the target Class-0 IoT devices.",

This research paper explores the transformative potential of IoB and presents an innovative IoB framework applied to an energy consumption scenario. Objective: we offer an innovative IoB ecosystem aimed at heightening citizens’ responsibility and awareness regarding home energy consumption in smart cities. Method: we propose a framework that elicits behavioral insights by leveraging smart meter data, clusters citizens based on similar energy consumption patterns using K-Means into groups, applies an LSTM-based prediction model to forecast their future energy consumption, and influences their behavior through a continuous personal reflection loop. Moreover, to foster trust, XAI principles are also integrated into our framework to ensure citizens comprehend and trust the IoB model’s results. Results: our proposed LSTM-based prediction model achieved, on the smart meters’ dataset, high-performance results, an R² value equal to 0,986, a root mean squared error of 0,492 and a mean squared error equal to 0,242. Conclusions: this paper presents how we can leverage the IoB and XAI into the energy sector. However, the IoB’s potential is not restricted to a certain domain. It has a revolutionary influence across sectors, with the power sector standing out as one of the domains where the IoB has the potential to alter social practices.",

    "Abstract": "Diabetes, a chronic illness, has seen an increase in prevalence over the years, posing several health challenges. This study aims to predict diabetes onset using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. We implemented several machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. To enhance model performance, we applied a variety of feature engineering techniques, including SelectKBest, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), Forward Feature Selection, and Backward Feature Elimination. RFECV proved to be the most effective method, leading to the selection of the best feature set. In addition, hyperparameter tuning techniques are used to determine the optimal parameters for the models created. Upon training these models with the optimized parameters, XGBoost outperformed the others with an accuracy of 94%, while Random Forest and CatBoost both achieved 92.5%. These results highlight XGBoost’s superior predictive power and the significance of thorough feature engineering and model tuning in diabetes prediction.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose behind this paper research is to localize and detect, for the first time, three types of shantytowns that can exist in both urban and rural areas in Morocco. The reason why we have conducted this study is the absence of diversity slum mapping in the form of dynamic GIS data, which can be a part of national development strategies to tackle the risk of further proliferation of shantytowns. Therefore, we first create a new database integration from five countries whose content contains 1366 high-resolution patches of 224 × 224 pixels divided into five classes: two types of “Urban Slum”, one type of “Rural Slum”, “Formal Buildings”, and non-built-up area. Second, we suggest employing a variety of performance metrics to come up with the best transfer learning-based models for the unfreezing stage. The study reveals that by handling the unfreezing of the front layers, we can produce a reliable new model where one condition is fulfilled, namely, where high-frequency dissimilarities have arisen between the target and the source datasets. Quantitative results of these methodologies show that our dataset and our unfreezing strategy for the mobilenetv2 model are more accurate compared to other competing models. This new model can localize all possible changes in morphology and shape among the three-slum types with state-of-the-art performance that reaches an overall accuracy of 98.17%, a loss of 0.062, and a kappa score of 97.71%. Our dataset and the code will be publicly available at the github1 to share our results.",

    "Title": "Prediction of Depression via Supervised Learning Models: Performance Comparison and Analysis",
    "Abstract": "This document Among all the various types of mental and psychosocial illnesses, the most commonly occurring type is depression. It can cause serious problems such as suicide. Therefore, early detection is important to stop the progression of this disease that could endanger human lives. Predicting and detecting early-stage depression using machine learning (ML) techniques is a promising strategy. This study’s main purpose is to assess which ML techniques are highly appropriate and accurate regarding such diagnoses. Six supervised ML techniques namely: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) were applied on dataset collected from Kaggle and compared for their accuracy (ACC) and performance in predicting depression. The performance of each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of ACC, F1-score, Precision (PR), and Sensitivity (SEN). Based on the experimental results analysis, we can conclude that SVM and LR performed better than all other methods with an ACC of 83,32%. Therefore, we found that a simple ML algorithm can be used to assist clinicians and practitioners predict depression at an early stage, with excellent potential utility and a considerable degree of ACC.",

    "Title": "An Ontological Model based on Machine Learning for Predicting Breast Cancer",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is mostly a female disease, but it may affect men as well even at a considerably lower percentage. An automated diagnosis system should be built for early detection because manual breast cancer diagnosis takes a long time. Doctors have lately achieved significant advances in the early identification and treatment of breast cancer in order to decrease the rate of mortality caused by the latter. Researchers, on the other hand, are analysing large amounts of complicated medical data by employing a combination of statistical and machine learning methodologies to assist clinicians in predicting breast cancer. Various machine learning approaches, including ontology-based Machine Learning methods, have lately played an essential role in medical science by building an automated system that can identify breast cancer. This study examines and evaluates the most popular machine learning algorithms, besides the ontological model based on Machine Learning. Among the classification methods investigated were Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbours. The dataset utilized has 683 instances and is available for download from the Kaggle website. The findings are assessed using performance measures generated from the confusion matrix, such as F-Measure, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the most critical reasons for death. Thus, CVD prediction is a crucial challenge in the field of clinical data analysis. Researchers are using a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to assess immense amounts of complex medical data, to help doctors predict heart disease. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to predict CVD using ML techniques and Ontology to build an efficient ontology-based model able to predict accurately the presence of cardiac disease and establish an early diagnosis. the approach consists of extracting rules from the Decision Tree algorithm that differentiate the patients with or without cardiovascular disease then implementing these rules in the ontology reasoner using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). The ontology model result reach high classification accuracy of 75% compared to the decision tree model. The approach can be employed in the medical field for the prediction of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "Title": "Road Accident Detection using SVM and Learning: A Comparative Study",
    "Abstract": "Everyday, a great deal of children and young adults (aged five to 29) lives are lost in road accidents. The most frequent causes are a driver’s behavior, the streets infrastructure is of lower quality and the delayed response of emergency services especially in rural areas. There is a need for automatics road accident systems detection that can assist in recognizing road accidents and determining their positions. This work reviews existing machine learning approaches for road accidents detection. We propose three distinct classifiers: Convolutional Neural Network CNN, Recurrent Convolution Neural Network R-CNN and Support Vector Machine SVM, using a CCTV footage dataset. These models are evaluated based on ROC curve, F1 measure, precision, accuracy and recall, and the achieved accuracies were 92%, 82%, and 93%, respectively. In addition, we suggest using an ensemble learning strategy to maximize the strengths of individual classifiers, raising detection accuracy to 94%.",

After this stage, the data becomes large. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the data that can be used for the efficient execution of the query. However, we have problems with solving entities, so it is necessary to use different techniques to analyze and verify the data quality in order to obtain good data management. Then, when we have a single database, we call this mechanism deduplication. To solve the problems above, we propose in this article a method to calculate the similarity between the potential duplicate data. This solution is based on graphics technology to narrow the search field for similar features. Then, a composite mechanism is used to locate the most similar records in our database to improve the quality of the data to make good decisions from heterogeneous sources.",

    "Title": "TOWARDS A FULLY CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM FOR ARABIC NLP",
    "Abstract": "Cloud Computing is getting more and more debated in the IT industry today. Its evolution is leading the next generation of internet services. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on understanding, manipulating and generating human language by machines. Thus, the NLP is really at the interface between computer science and linguistics. It, therefore, concerns the ability of the machine to interact directly with humans. Arabic NLP is very poor compared to other languages such as English or German due to the complexity of this language and the lack of resources. In this work, we propose a new system for Arabic NLP based entirely on the Cloud. This system is based on two steps. It firstly uses a bridge between Arabic and other developed languages (English for occurrence) and then uses of the already developed features for that language. Hence those features apply not on the Arabic text but instead on the translated (the English) one. In some cases, the result needs to be in Arabic, in which case, we use the bridge another time to translate English result into Arabic. This can either be used in real NLP systems, such as Translation, IR, QA, Sentiment Analysis, or for validation or comparison purposes, especially for those who work in NLP and use other approaches. Experiments have been performed on a prototype we developed and the results obtained are satisfactory for this first version.",

    "Title": "A highly scalable CF recommendation system using ontology and SVD-based incremental approach",
    "Abstract": "In recent years, the need of recommender systems has increased to enhance user engagement, provide personalized services, and increase revenue, especially in the online shopping industry where vast amounts of customer data are generated. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used and effective approach for generating appropriate recommendations. However, the current CF approach has limitations in addressing common recommendation problems such as data inaccuracy recommendations, sparsity, scalability, and significant errors in prediction. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid CF method for movie recommendations that combines the incremental singular value decomposition approach with an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach in two phases, online and offline. The ontology-based technique is leveraged to enhance the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. Evaluating our method on a real-world movie recommendation dataset using precision, F1 scores, and mean absolute error (MAE) demonstrates that our system generates accurate predictions while addressing sparsity and scalability issues in recommendation system. Additionally, our method has the advantage of reduced running time.",

    "Abstract": "Emotions are a vital and fundamental part of life. Everything we do, say, or do not say, somehow reflects some of our feelings, perhaps not immediately. To analyze a human's most fundamental behavior, we must examine these feelings using emotional data, also known as affect data. Text, voice, and other types of data can be used. Affective Computing, which uses this emotional data to analyze emotions, is a scientific fields. Emotion computation is a difficult task; significant progress has been made, but there is still scope for improvement. With the introduction of social networking sites, it is now possible to connect with people from all over the world. Many people are attracted to examining the text available on these various social websites. Analyzing this data through the Internet means we're exploring the entire continent, taking in all of the communities and cultures along the way. This paper analyze text emotion of Iraqi people about COVID-19 using data collected from twitter, People's opinions can be classified based on lexicon into different separate classifications of feelings (anticipation, anger, trust, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust, and joy) as well as two distinct emotions (positive and negative), which can then be visualized using charts to find the most prevalent emotion using lexicon-based analysis",

    "Abstract": "Coronavirus (covid 19) is one of the most dangerous viruses that have spread all over the world. With the increasing number of cases infected with the coronavirus, it has become necessary to address this epidemic by all available means. Detection of the covid-19 is currently one of the world's most difficult challenges. Data science and machine learning (ML), for example, can aid in the battle against this pandemic. Furthermore, various research published in this direction proves that ML techniques can identify illness and viral infections more precisely, allowing patients' diseases to be detected at an earlier stage. In this paper, we will present how ontologies can aid in predicting the presence of covid-19 based on symptoms. The integration of ontology and ML is achieved by implementing rules of the decision tree algorithm into ontology reasoner. In addition, we compared the outcomes with various ML classifications used to make predictions. The findings are assessed using performance measures generated from the confusion matrix, such as F-measure, accuracy, precision, and recall. The ontology surpassed all ML algorithms with high accuracy value of 97.4%, according to the results.",

    "Title": "Bridging the gap between the semantic web and big data: answering SPARQL queries over NoSQL databases",
    "Abstract": "Nowadays, the database field has gotten much more diverse, and as a result, a variety of non-relational (NoSQL) databases have been created, including JSON-document databases and key-value stores, as well as extensible markup language (XML) and graph databases. Due to the emergence of a new generation of data services, some of the problems associated with big data have been resolved. In addition, in the haste to address the challenges of big data, NoSQL abandoned several core databases features that make them extremely efficient and functional, for instance the global view, which enables users to access data regardless of how it is logically structured or physically stored in its sources. In this article, we propose a method that allows us to query non-relational databases based on the ontology-based access data (OBDA) framework by delegating SPARQL protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) queries from ontology to the NoSQL database. We applied the method on a popular database called Couchbase and we discussed the result obtained.",

    "Abstract": "Today, with the emergence of semantic web technologies and increasing of information quantity, searching for information based on the semantic web has become a fertile area of research. For this reason, a large number of studies are performed based on the measure of semantic similarity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new method of semantic similarity measuring which uses the dynamic programming to compute the semantic distance between any two concepts defined in the same hierarchy of ontology. Then, we base on this result to compute the semantic similarity. Finally, we present an experimental comparison between our method and other methods of similarity measuring. Where we will show the limits of these methods and how we avoid them with our method. This one bases on a function of weight allocation, which allows finding different rate of semantic similarity between a given concept and two other sibling concepts which is impossible using the other methods.",

    "Abstract": "Security Operation Center represents nowadays an indispensable component of the socio-technical system by supporting businesses to protect their security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability against cyberthreats and security attacks.The Security Operation Center provides various service levels and capabilities that need to be continuously assessed and tracked to ensure improvement of the main success factor of the SOC, which include technologies, processes, and SOC analysts. SOC analysts’ performance evaluation remains problematic due to the choice of the performance metrics and their inadequacy with the SOC socio-technical system. While we have some quantitative and qualitative measures to assess the performance of a SOC analyst, SOC capabilities, and SOC maturity levels, this evaluation is based on root cause analysis and independent evaluation of SOC elements, which is unrealistic, given the complex and evolving nature of SOC systems. However, the baselines of the performance metrics are the SOC challenges announced by the SOC analysts and their ability to face, reduce, and overcome them to provide and maintain a high detection rate of malicious and abnormal behaviors. We provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by SOC analysts based on our previous study, and we provide a deep analysis of the challenges and the interconnexion of those challenges. Furthermore, we present the quantitative performance metrics and their weaknesses to assess the performance of the SOC analysts due to the SOC socio-technical system nature. Our study will enable SOC managers, analysts, and decision-makers to have clear visibility and details on the quantitative performance metrics and will provide a baseline for a new performance metrics model.",

    "Title": "Artificial intelligence for assessing the planets' positions as a precursor to earthquake events",
    "Abstract": "Questions about interconnection possibilities between planets’ positions and seismic events on the earth have emerged recently in TV channels, social media, etc. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) are used to predict the number of earthquakes that can occur on Earth, depending on the Earth's position relative to other planets and solar positions. Our new integration dataset contains 9809 observations and nine features firstly from the global earthquake archive, which is an authoritative layer by Esri, and secondly from the accurate data web portal “theskylive.com.”. The results obtained from RFR and ANN prove the partial influence of planets positions on sesimic activity on the earth. In other words, quantitatively through the ANN that gets an accuracy of 68.27 %, MAE of 5.36, MSE of 52.78, RMSE of 7.26, R-Squared of 0.65, and also through the RFR that gets an accuracy of 65.06 %, MAE of 5.60, MSE of 58.21, RMSE of 7.63, R-Squared of 0.67, prove the partial influence on one hand. Qualitatively through the curve of the training phase of the ANN, which is a decreasing and convex function, reinforces the aforementioned proof on the other hand. For these reasons, it can be deduced that there is a possible connection between tectonic stress triggers and the positions of the planets in the solar system. Our dataset was uploaded to the github(https://github.com/mouddentarik/Earthquake01.) as well as the code will be publicly available at the github(https://github.com/mouddentarik/PythonCode_Earthquakes-.) to share our results.",

To avoid this drawback while retaining the main advantages of the MCSA method, this paper proposes a new approach for discrimination between demagnetization and eccentricity faults in PMSMs. The proposed approach is based on the simultaneous monitoring of the real and imaginary components of the characteristic harmonics of these faults, which are obtained from stator current spectral analysis.

    "Abstract": "Objective\nEndourological treatment is assoSummary ciated with a risk of postoperative febrile urinary tract infections and sepsis. The aim of this study was to review the reported rate of infectious complications in relation to the type and modality of the endourologic procedure.\nMethods\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Two electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) were searched. Out of 243 articles retrieved we included 49 studies after full-text evaluation.\nResults\nRandom-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) were associated with not significantly different odds of getting fever (OR= 1.54, 95% CI: 0.99 to 2.39; p= 0.06) or sepsis (OR= 1.52, 95% CI: 0.37 to 6.20, p= 0.56). The odds of getting fever were not significantly different for mini PCNL compared to standard PCNL (OR= 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.44; p= 0.45) and for tubeless PCNL compared to standard PCNL (OR= 1.34 95% CI: 0.61 to 2.91, p= 0.47). However, the odds for fever after PCNL with suctioning sheath were lower than the corresponding odds for standard PCNL (OR= 0.37, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.70, p= 0.002). The odds of getting fever after PCNL with perioperative prophylaxis were not different from the corresponding odds after PCNL with perioperative prophylaxis plus a short oral antibiotic course (before or after the procedure)(OR= 1.31, 95% CI: 0.71 to 2.39, p= 0.38).\nConclusions\nThe type of endourological procedure does not appear to be decisive in the onset of infectious complications, although the prevention of high intrarenal pressure during the …",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the most critical reasons for death. Thus, CVD prediction is a crucial challenge in the field of clinical data analysis. Researchers are using a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to assess immense amounts of complex medical data, to help doctors predict heart disease. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to predict CVD using ML techniques and Ontology to build an efficient ontology-based model able to predict accurately the presence of cardiac disease and establish an early diagnosis. the approach consists of extracting rules from the Decision Tree algorithm that differentiate the patients with or without cardiovascular disease then implementing these rules in the ontology reasoner using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). The ontology model result reach high classification accuracy of 75% compared to the decision tree model. The approach can be employed in the medical field for the prediction of cardiovascular diseases.",

This approach is based on the application of a very selective band-pass filter in the stator current. A judicious calculation of the parameters of this filter makes it possible to extract only the frequency signatures of searched faults. The use of the relevant information on the magnitude and phase angle of the signatures, obtained by filtering, makes it possible to distinguish between both of the studied faults. The simple monitoring of the plotting in terms of polar coordinates of the combined information (magnitude/phase angle) of the signature’s characteristic of these two faults allows for this discernment. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach when it …",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, the database field has gotten much more diverse, and as a result, a variety of non-relational (NoSQL) databases have been created, including JSON-document databases and key-value stores, as well as extensible markup language (XML) and graph databases. Due to the emergence of a new generation of data services, some of the problems associated with big data have been resolved. In addition, in the haste to address the challenges of big data, NoSQL abandoned several core databases features that make them extremely efficient and functional, for instance the global view, which enables users to access data regardless of how it is logically structured or physically stored in its sources. In this article, we propose a method that allows us to query non-relational databases based on the ontology-based access data (OBDA) framework by delegating SPARQL protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) queries from ontology to the NoSQL database.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, the need of recommender systems has increased to enhance user engagement, provide personalized services, and increase revenue, especially in the online shopping industry where vast amounts of customer data are generated. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used and effective approach for generating appropriate recommendations. However, the current CF approach has limitations in addressing common recommendation problems such as data inaccuracy recommendations, sparsity, scalability, and significant errors in prediction. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid CF method for movie recommendations that combines the incremental singular value decomposition approach with an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach in two phases, online and offline. The ontology-based technique is leveraged to enhance the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. Evaluating our method on a real-world movie recommendation dataset using precision, F1 scores, and mean absolute error (MAE) demonstrates that our system generates accurate predictions while addressing sparsity and scalability issues in recommendation system. Additionally, our method has the advantage of reduced running time.",

    "Abstract": "Kilka ostatnich badań dotyczących nowych metod diagnostycznych krytykuje klasyczną metodę gęstości widmowej mocy techniką periodogramu ze względu na jej wady związane z rozdzielczością częstotliwości. Rzeczywiście, ta technika jest mniej skuteczna w wykrywaniu sygnatur częstotliwości uszkodzeń blisko harmonicznej o dużejj amplitudzie. Ponadto nie jest w stanie wykryć początkowej usterki. Jednak ta metoda ma kilka zalet, takich jak krótki czas obliczeń i łatwe programowanie. Aby uniknąć tych wad, biorąc pod uwagę zalety metody, w niniejszym artykule zaproponowano prostą procedurę precyzyjnego zdefiniowania parametrów kształtu nowego okna należącego do rodziny podniesionych cosinusów. Ta procedura wykorzystuje właściwości widma prądu stojana, aby zapewnić niezawodną diagnozę w przypadku początkowej fazy uszkodzenia, przy jednoczesnym zachowaniu szybkiego czasu przetwarzania. Przeprowadzone testy eksperymentalne dowodzą skuteczności sugerowanego podejścia w diagnozowaniu początkowej fazy uszkodzenia występującej w silnik indukcyjny (Diagnostyka uszkodzeń wirnika z wykorzystaniem regulowanej funkcji okna).",

    "Title": "SURVEYING THE BLACK BOX: AN OVERVIEW OF CONTEXT-AWARE RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS",
    "Abstract": "Researchers and practitioners across various fields such as data mining, marketing, management, mobile computing, and personalized e-commerce have increasingly recognized the importance of contextual information in refining user experiences. Traditional recommender systems, however, tend to focus basicly on recommending the most relevant items to users, often overlooking essential contextual factors like time, location, or social context (e.g., dining out with friends or watching a movie). Addressing this limitation, recent advancements in context-aware recommender systems (CARSs) leverage contextual data to improve recommendation quality, gaining considerable traction in the research community. In this paper, we present an overview of CARS, tracing its evolution and the diverse approaches that have emerged over recent years. We provide a critical review of recent context-based recommendation methods to highlight prevailing trends and limitations. From this analysis, we then identify supplementary features that could enhance context-aware recommender systems. Finally, we explore promising research directions that could overcome current limitations, encouraging experts to collaborate in advancing context-aware recommendation technologies further.",

    "Abstract": "Today, with the emergence of semantic web technologies and increasing of information quantity, searching for information based on the semantic web has become a fertile area of research. For this reason, a large number of studies are performed based on the measure of semantic similarity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new method of semantic similarity measuring which uses the dynamic programming to compute the semantic distance between any two concepts defined in the same hierarchy of ontology. Then, we base on this result to compute the semantic similarity. Finally, we present an experimental comparison between our method and other methods of similarity measuring. Where we will show the limits of these methods and how we avoid them with our method. This one bases on a function of weight allocation, which allows finding different rate of semantic similarity between a given concept and two other sibling concepts which is impossible using the other methods.",

It is known that the cost of migrations and preemptions has significant influence on global system performances. The EKG algorithm can generate a great number of migrant tasks, but it has the advantage that each migrant task migrates between two processors only. Later, the EDHS algorithm has been proposed in order to minimize the number of migrant tasks of EKG. Although EDHS minimizes the number of migration compared to EKG, its drawback is the generation of additional preemptions caused by the migrations on several processors. In this paper we propose a new tasks allocation algorithm that aims to combine the advantages of EKG (migrations between two processors only) and those of EDHS (reduction of number of migrations).",

    "Abstract": "Human activity detection is a research field that has been growing rapidly for the last few decades. It opens a wide field of applications in the fields of healthcare, smart homes, robotics, human-media interaction, surveillance and security. WiFi-based solutions have received a lot of attention lately. These are based on the idea that nearby wireless signals are affected by human bodies. Reflections are produced by the presence of static objects like walls and furniture, while additional propagation paths are produced by the presence of dynamic objects such humans. This paper proposes using WiFi for a low-cost, device-free human activity monitoring system, as it is readily available in the office and home these days. It is also ubiquitous in nature as it collects information about the environment while providing Internet. The idea behind this approach is to acquire and model changes in multipath WiFi radio waves due to human movement. Experimental validation in practical situations with varying occupants, different environmental conditions, and interference from WiFi devices is used to demonstrate robustness and scalability.",

In this paper, we propose a low-cost, non-intrusive method to remotely monitor elderly people without deploying devices on their bodies in a given space, using channel state information (CSI) from passive WiFi detection. Specifically, we monitored variables such as sitting and standing activity, and experimental validation in practical situations with variable occupants, various environmental settings, and interference from other WiFi devices demonstrates robustness and scalability. Our results suggest that the proposed method can be put into practical-real use to detect activity and alert emergency personnel immediately, providing rapid medical assistance, saving lives, minimizing damage, and reducing anxiety for elderly people residing alone.",

In this paper, we propose a device-free human activity recognition system that leverages the rich information behind WiFi signals to detect human activities in indoor environments, including walking, sitting, and standing. The key idea of our system is to use the dynamic features of activities, which we carefully examine and analyze through the characteristics of channel state information. We evaluate the impact of location changes on WiFi signal distribution for different activities and design an activity detection system that employs signal processing techniques to extract discriminative features from wireless signals in the frequency and temporal domains. We implement our system on a single off-the-shelf WiFi device connecting to a commercial wireless access point and evaluate it in laboratory and conference room environments. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using WiFi signals for device-free human activity recognition, which could provide a practical and non-intrusive solution for indoor monitoring and ubiquitous computing applications.",

This interest is due to the prominent importance of this 6th most wide-spread language in the world with more than 350 million native speakers. Currently, some basic Arabic language challenges related to the high inflection and derivation, Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging, and diacritical ambiguity of Arabic text are practically tamed to a great extent. However, the development of high level and intelligent applications such as Question Answering (QA) systems is still obstructed by the lacks in terms of ontologies and other semantic resources. In this paper, we present the construction of a new Arabic ontology leveraging the contents of Arabic WordNet (AWN) and Arabic VerbNet (AVN).

Integrating a controlled natural language makes the platform more comfortable (for users), more powerful and helps so to eliminate this weakness.

    "Title": "Roadmap for an Arabic Controlled Language",
    "Abstract": "Controlled Natural Languages or CNLs are artificial subsets of natural languages that aim to make communication clearer and more precise. In general, CNLs are used in communication between humans or with computers and, particularly, when clarity and unambiguity are required. Existing CNLs have been developed to be exploited in many applications such as technical documentation, machine translation or database query language. So far, many CNLs have been developed for Western languages, especially English, but no concrete CNL has yet been proposed for Arabic even with the increasing number of Arabic Internet users in the last two decades. In this paper, we propose a roadmap for developing an Arabic CNL to provide new kind and advanced natural language services for Arabic people. Methodologically speaking, we review the most important existing CNLs in English and other languages helping us knowing some statistics related to the vocabulary size and the number of grammar rules that could help in designing the new CNL. This paper proposes two major approaches; one relies on leveraging on already-built CNLs, whereas the other consists in starting from scratch. The survey of Arabic NLP challenges along the available resources and tools allowed us to favor the second approach as the basis for the proposed roadmap.",

    "Title": "TOWARDS A FULLY CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM FOR ARABIC NLP",
    "Abstract": "Cloud Computing is getting more and more debated in the IT industry today. Its evolution is leading the next generation of internet services. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on understanding, manipulating and generating human language by machines. Thus, the NLP is really at the interface between computer science and linguistics. It, therefore, concerns the ability of the machine to interact directly with humans. Arabic NLP is very poor compared to other languages such as English or German due to the complexity of this language and the lack of resources. In this work, we propose a new system for Arabic NLP based entirely on the Cloud. This system is based on two steps. It firstly uses a bridge between Arabic and other developed languages (English for occurrence) and then uses of the already developed features for that language. Hence those features apply not on the Arabic text but instead on the translated (the English) one. In some cases, the result needs to be in Arabic, in which case, we use the bridge another time to translate English result into Arabic. This can either be used in real NLP systems, such as Translation, IR, QA, Sentiment Analysis, or for validation or comparison purposes, especially for those who work in NLP and use other approaches. Experiments have been performed on a prototype we developed and the results obtained are satisfactory for this first version.",

Big data has risen to become the most sought-after field in computer science. The e-commerce evolved significantly and continued to flow until now and even after the pandemic. So, big data technologies helped with the development and approach to collecting, storing, processing, and extracting the data in this field. This paper proposes an application programming interface (API) data extractor tool applied to a collection of e-commerce public websites named \"Klarna dataset\" to extract its data, and an analysis of the results. The study of e-commerce sales has given results matching universal e-commerce sales tendencies. The peak of the number of e-commerce transactions and sales was between 2018-2019. Thus, the highest e-commerce sales price was in the United States for \"luxury\" or \"fancy\" products, and the highest sales in Europe were in Frankfurt, Germany, for hardware and gaming material.",

Our primary objective is to accurately identify and classify malicious applications to enhance the security of Android devices. In this study, we employed the RF algorithm to analyze a comprehensive dataset of Android applications, where the classification of each application as either malware or benign is known. The method was rigorously tested, yielding impressive results: an average accuracy of 98.47%, a sensitivity of 98.60%, and an F-score of 98.60%. These metrics underscore the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we conducted a comparative analysis of the RF algorithm against other malware detection methods. The results demonstrate that the RF algorithm outperforms these alternative methods, offering superior detection capabilities and contributing to more robust Android security measures.",

    "Title": "Unified and evolved approach based on neural network and deep learning methods for intrusion detection",
    "Abstract": "Currently, network security has become a major concern for all entities around the world. Attackers employ various methods to disrupt services, which requires new methods to stop them all in one way. Moreover, these intrusions can evolve and overcome security measures and devices, which pushes to use new evolving methods able to accompany the evolution of these threats, to block them. In our paper, we propose a new approach for intrusion detection, founded on neural network (NN) and deep learning (DL) methods. This approach is planned to not only identify threats, but also to develop a long-term memory of them, in order to detect new ones resembling these memorized attacks, and simultaneously, to provide a single way to stop all kinds of intrusions. To test our model, we have chosen the most recently employed methods in literature, NN and DL algorithms: feedforward neural network (FNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), then we have applied them on network security layer-knowledge discovery in databases (NSL KDD) intrusions dataset. The results of experiments were impressive for all the algorithms, with maximum performances noted by LSTM, which affirms the efficacy of our proposed method for intrusion detection.",

    "Abstract": "Institutional investors normally define the market segments that present more opportunities for profitability based on their commitments, their financial and accounting situations and the regulations that govern the structure of their investments in equities, bonds, real estate and infrastructure. Their investment strategies consist of defining the allocation of their assets after having fixed the proportion to be invested in each segment. We will try through this work to estimate and optimize the parts of assets invested in shares of pension funds, insurance companies and UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities), according to their degree of integration into the Moroccan economy, weight of their assets in market capitalization and by the heterogeneity that characterizes their investment decisions on the capital market. Panel data are well suited to our analysis in the sense that they allow us to measure the impact of several actions (stimuli), alone or simultaneously, and the synergies (interactions) of data, which are numerous on investors and on market indicators on the financial market.

    "Title": "Minimizing the variance of the coverage ratio as an approach to optimize the exchange rate risk of Brent futures contracts",
    "Abstract": "Derivatives markets show that their structure is always characterized by periods of strong price fluctuations. This is true regardless of the underlying asset of the futures contracts considered, whether they are commodities, interest rates, exchange rates, shares, stock market indices, etc. By locking in future prices, the primary objective of these markets is to limit the risks faced by operators. This article proposes a new method of optimizing the coverage ratio by futures contracts to minimize price variance and thus apply this new technique to reduce the risk associated with Brent price volatility for the period from January 2010 to December 2020. The variance minimization model of Ederington's (1979) is the first and most widely used coverage model and the one that dominates the literature on this area which helps to find the optimal coverage ratio, and is also the objective function in our particle assay optimization algorithm in MATLAB and we will better interpret our results with statistical analysis and lastly, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the coverage model.",

    "Abstract": "The electro-thermomechanical modeling study of the High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) has been presented, all the necessary equations are detailed and coupled. This proposed modeling by the finite element method using the Comsol multiphysics software, allowed to study the multiphysics behaviour of the transistor and to observe the different degradations in the structure of the component. Then, an optimization study is necessary to avoid failures in the transistor. In this work, we have used the Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) method to solve the optimization problem, but it requires a very important computing time. Therefore, we proposed the kriging assisted CMA-ES method (KA-CMA-ES), it is an integration of the kriging metamodel in the CMA-ES method, it allows us to solve the problem of optimization and overcome the constraint of calculation time. All these methods are well detailed in this paper. The coupling of the finite element model developed on Comsol Multiphysics and the KA-CMA-ES method on Matlab software, allowed to optimize the multiphysics behaviour of the transistors. We made a comparison between the results of the numerical simulations of the initial state and the optimal state of the component. It was found that the proposed KA-CMA-ES method is efficient in solving optimization problems.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a probability study about spring of clutch structure. In the structure problems, the randomness and the uncertainties of the distribution of the structural parameters are a crucial problem. In the case of Reliability Based Design Optimization (RBDO), it is the objective is to play a dominant role in the structural optimization problem introducing the reliability concept. The RBDO problem is often formulated as a minimization of the initial structural cost under constraints imposed on the values of elemental reliability indices corresponding to various limit states. This paper proposes a new method for a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm (MPSO) combined with a simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and RBDO. MPSO is known as an efficient approach with a high performance of solving optimization problems in many research fields. It is a population intelligence algorithm inspired by social behavior simulations of bird flocking. Numerical results show the robustness of the MPSO-SA algorithm and RBDO. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the prediction of taxi trip fares using two linear regression methods: normal equations (ordinary least squares solution (OLS)) and limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS). Utilizing a dataset of New York City yellow taxi trips from 2023, the analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training. The data consists of over 12 million records, managed, and processed that involves configuring the Spark driver and executor memory to efficiently process the Parquet-format data stored on hadoop distributed file system (HDFS). Key features influencing fare amount, such as passenger count, trip distance, fare amount, and tip amount, were analyzed for correlation. Models were trained on an 80-20 train-test split, and their performance was evaluated using root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean squared error (MSE). Results show that both methods provide comparable accuracy, with slight differences in coefficients and training time. Additionally, vendor performance metrics, including total trips, average trip distance, fare amount, and tip amount, were analyzed to reveal trends and inform strategic decisions for fleet management. This comprehensive analysis demonstrates the efficacy of linear regression techniques in predicting taxi fares and offers valuable insights for optimizing taxi operations.",

    "Title": "Optimization of the impact measurement of market structure on liquidity and volatility",
    "Abstract": "Liquidity and volatility are the two barometers that allow stock markets to appreciate in terms of attractiveness, profitability and efficiency. Several macroeconomic and microstructure variables condition the level of liquidity that directly impact the asset allocation decisions of different investor profiles - institutional and individuals - and therefore the dynamics of the market as a whole. Volatility is the regulatory component that provides information on the level of risk that characterizes the market. Thus, the appreciation of these two elements is of considerable help to fund managers looking to optimize their equity pockets. In this work, we will use the liquidity ratio as a proxy variable for the liquidity of the Moroccan stock market, to estimate the indicators and factors that determine its short- and long-term variability. The appropriate econometric method would be to estimate an error correction vector model (ECVM) which has the property of determining the long- and short-term relationships between the variables. The volatility of the MASI index will be the subject of a second estimate to capture the shape of the function of its evolution.",

Both reliability methods are applicable to the implicit limit state functions through numerical models, like those based on the Assumed Mode Method.

In modified approaches, the algorithms are based on heuristic optimization methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing Optimization. Numerical applications in static, dynamic and stability problems are used to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of proposed methodology. These examples consist in a rectangular plates subjected to in-plane external loads, material and geometrical parameters which are considered as random variables.

In general, CNLs are used in communication between humans or with computers and, particularly, when clarity and unambiguity are required. Existing CNLs have been developed to be exploited in many applications such as technical documentation, machine translation or database query language. So far, many CNLs have been developed for Western languages, especially English, but no concrete CNL has yet been proposed for Arabic even with the increasing number of Arabic Internet users in the last two decades. In this paper, we propose a roadmap for developing an Arabic CNL to provide new kind and advanced natural language services for Arabic people. Methodologically speaking, we review the most important existing CNLs in English and other languages helping us knowing some statistics related to the vocabulary size and the number of grammar rules that could help in designing the new CNL. This paper proposes two major approaches; one relies on leveraging on already-built CNLs, whereas the other consists in starting from scratch. The survey of Arabic NLP challenges along the available resources and tools allowed us to favor the second approach as the basis for the proposed roadmap.",

    "Title": "Clock-Latency-Aware Pre-CTS for better Timing Closure in VLSI Design",
    "Abstract": "A common strategy for reducing the time jump due to a clock tree insertion is to add a clock uncertainty value. If a small clock uncertainty value is selected for the Pre-CTS optimization, then a significant timing jump is observed when the clock tree is inserted, and clock timings are propagated. On the other hand, if the clock uncertainty is large, then the place and route (PNR) flow does not converge. This approach has been proven to be insufficient as each timing path is affected differently by the creation of the clock tree. In this paper, we suggest a more targeted approach whereby all pins in the clock tree will be annotated with their estimated latency, and therefore clock arrival times under ideal clocks should closely model the post-CTS arrival times. This objective is achieved by introducing an accurate and fast clock prediction early in the flow at the pre-CTS stage. As a result, the transition from the pre-CTS stage to the post-CTS stage becomes easier without significant timing jumps. An experiment on nine commercial test cases led to a significant TNS timing improvement of up to 68%, with an average of 35% at the end of the route stage. The full PNR flow runtime is not impacted. We achieved a 3% average runtime reduction over all test cases.",

    "Title": "Improving the efficiency and security of passport control processes at airports by using the R-CNN object detection model",
    "Abstract": "The use of real-time machine learning to optimize passport control procedures at airports can greatly improve both the efficiency and security of the processes. To automate and optimize these procedures, AI algorithms such as character recognition, facial recognition, predictive algorithms and automatic data processing can be implemented. The proposed method is to use the R-CNN object detection model to detect passport objects in real-time images collected by passport control cameras. This paper describes the step-by-step process of the proposed approach, which includes pre-processing, training and testing the R-CNN model, integrating it into the passport control system, and evaluating its accuracy and speed for efficient passenger flow management at international airports. The implementation of this method has shown superior performance to previous methods in terms of reducing errors, delays and associated costs.",

    "Title": "MQTT-PRESENT: Approach to secure internet of things applications using MQTT protocol",
    "Abstract": "The big challenge to raise for deploying the application's domain of the Internet of Things is security. As one of the popular messaging protocols in the IoT world, the message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) is designed for constrained devices and machine-to-machine communications, based on the publish-subscribe model, it offers a basic authentication using username and password. However, this authentication method might have a problem in terms of security and scalability. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the current research in the literature related to the security for the MQTT protocol, before we give a brief description of each algorithm used on our approach, to finally propose a new approach to secure this protocol based on AugPAKE algorithm and PRESENT encryption. This solution provides mutual authentication between the broker and their clients (publishers and subscribers), the confidentiality of the published message is protected twice, the integrity and non-repudiation of MQTT messages which is protected during the process of transmission.",

    "Abstract": "Power consumption is one of the major criteria of an Integrated Circuit (IC) and becomes more important than performance and surface in some applications. Therefore, it is necessary to find new techniques to reduce the power consumed by an IC. This study presents two power-aware techniques: Toggle rate and capacitance-toggle rate weighting which aims to reduce the switching power of nets at the placement stage. These techniques drive the placement engine to reduce the wire length of critical power nets by placing their relative cells close to each other. For an optimal solution, the weighting is applied only on power critical nets that consume more than 80% of the total power in the connection. Experimental results on nine IC industrial designs show an average improvement of 11.8% in total net power and 3.7% of total consumed power.",

    "Abstract": "Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most used additive manufacturing processes in the current time. Predicting the impact of different 3D printing parameters on the quality of printed parts is one of the critical challenges facing researchers. The present paper aims to examine the effect of three FDM process parameters, namely deposition velocity, extrusion temperature, and raster orientation on the bending strength, stiffness, and deflection at break of polylactic acid (PLA) parts using Taguchi design of experiment technique. The results indicate that the temperature has the highest impact on the mechanical properties of PLA specimens followed by the velocity and the orientation. The optimum composition offering the best mechanical behavior was determined. The optimal predicted response was 159.78 N, 39.92 N/mm, and 12.55 mm for the bending strength, bending stiffness, and deflection at break, respectively. The R2 obtained from analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed good agreement between the experimental results and those predicted using a regression model.",

    "Title": "A new multi-bit flip-flop merging mechanism for power consumption reduction in the physical implementation stage of ICs conception",
    "Abstract": "�Recently, the multi-bit flip-flop (MBFF) technique was introduced as a method for reducing the power consumption and chip area of integrated circuits (ICs) during the physical implementation stage of their development process. From the perspective of the consumer, the main requirements for such an optimization method are high performance, low power usage and small area (PPA). Therefore, any new optimization technique should improve at least one, if not all, of these requirements. This paper proposes a new low-power methodology, applying a MBFF merging solution during the physical implementation of an IC to achieve better power consumption and area reduction. The aim of this study is to prove the benefit of this methodology on the power saving capability of the system while demonstrating that the proposed methodology does not have a negative impact on the circuit performance and design routability. The experimental results show that MBFF merging of 76% can be achieved and preserved throughout the entire physical implementation process, from cell placement to the final interconnection routing, without impacting the system’s performance or routability. Moreover, the clock wirelength, nets and buffers needed to balance the clock network were reduced by 11.98%, 3.82% and 9.16%, respectively. The reduction of the clock tree elements led to a reduction of the power consumption of the clock nets, registers and cells by 22.11%, 20.84% and 12.38%, respectively. The total power consumption of the design was reduced by 2.67%.",

    "Title": "Improvement of the LTE handover algorithms in terms of quality of service",
    "Abstract": "With the emergence of new possibilities and user requirements in the field of mobile technology, long term evolution (LTE) is the most popular as it offers high-speed service. LTE is a 4G wireless network developed by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). The implementation of LTE is strongly affected by the quality of service (QoS) when transfer management is the main issue. Handover management allows communication to be maintained when switching from one base station to another. In this paper, we explain that there are several types of transfers that are not efficient in terms of quality of services such as throughput, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and latency. For this purpose, we thought of creating a new algorithm on the A1 and A3 events and the reference signal received quality (RSRQ). Our algorithm is effective compared to other already available algorithms using the NS3 network simulator.",

    "Title": "Wire-demotion for Static Timing Optimization in Advanced Technology Nodes",
    "Abstract": "In Integrated Circuits (ICs) conception, the timing optimization techniques continually need enhancements. One way to avoid area increase during hold optimization is to optimize routing in order to bring down the Worst Hold and the Total Hold Slacks (WHS/THS) before regular Hold optimization. High performance, low power and small area (PPA) are the most customer requirements from new technology nodes. This indicates that any new optimization technique should improve one or all of the aforementioned requirements. This study, consider the high resistance sensitivity to “Self-Aligned Double Patterning” (SADP) process as an advantage and suggest a new timing optimization technique based on wire promotion. It consists on driving the EDA tool to use high resistive SADP layers for wires on hold timing paths. Which will free-up less resistive No-SADP layers for wires on setup timing paths. The target nets are issued by a statistical approach that helps on getting the targets with the maximum benefit. Experience on multiple nm-SADP designs shows 41 % WHS and 37% THS improvement with 0% area increase, compared to baseline flow. As a consequence, the worst negative and the total negative slacks (WHS/THS) are also well conserved and even improved up to 24 and 83%, respectively in some test-cases.",

In addition, distance learning assessment is becoming increasingly popular as it is convenient for students with busy schedules who cannot attend face-to-face assessments. In this paper, we focus on the use of intelligent agents on the Moodle platform to improve the assessment process of distance learning. We present three contributions that aim to improve the developed models: firstly, the digitisation of assessment to collect, store and analyse data; secondly, the adoption of a multi-agent skills assessment environment to automate some assessment tasks; thirdly, the adoption of the leadership and management development (LMD) programme to improve the continuous training of learners by offering greater flexibility, adaptability and relevance to their needs.",

    "Abstract": "Technology is a revolution that allows humans to use several apparatus. The radiations emitted by these apparatus have a negative effect on human health, but until now these effects remains suspected only. The determination of the level of the radiation exposure remains important by elaborating the specific absorption rate models that may determine the level of exposure to several sources because all studies are focused on one source of radiation. This model will allow to verify if the level of exposure is under the requirement in case of several radiations sources, mainly with significant apparatus that surround the human even if each radiation of the apparatus is required under strict norms. The goal of this paper is to develop the specific absorption rate calculation model according to the number of radiation sources that can co-exist in a geographical area, this model will be validated by the comparison between the simulated values of this model and the measurements achieved et Ibn Tofail by EM radiation meters.",

    "Title": "An optimal energy management system for real-time operation of multiagent-based microgrids using a T-cell algorithm",
    "Abstract": "The real-time operation of the energy management system (RT-EMS) is one of the vital functions of Microgrids (MG). In this context, the reliability and smooth operation should be maintained in real time regardless of load and generation variations and without losing the optimum operation cost. This paper presents a design and implementation of a RT-EMS based on Multiagent system (MAS) and the fast converging T-Cell algorithm to minimize the MG operational cost and maximize the real-time response in grid-connected MG. The RT-EMS has the main function to ensure the energy dispatch between the distributed generation (DG) units that consist in this work on a wind generator, solar energy, energy storage units, controllable loads and the main grid. A modular multi-agent platform is proposed to implement the RT-EMS. The MAS has features such as peer-to-peer communication capability, a fault-tolerance structure, and high flexibility, which make it convenient for MG context. Each component of the MG has its own managing agent. While, the MG optimizer (MGO) is the agent responsible for running the optimization and ensuring the seamless operation of the MG in real time, the MG supervisor (MGS) is the agent that intercepts sudden high load variations and computes the new optimum operating point. In addition, the proposed RT-EMS develops an integration of the MAS platform with the Data Distribution Service (DDS) as a middleware to communicate with the physical units. In this work, the proposed algorithm minimizes the cost function of the MG as well as maximizes the use of renewable energy generation; Then, it assigns the power reference to each DG of the MG. The total time delay of the optimization and the communication between the EMS components were reduced. To verify the performance of our proposed system, an experimental validation in a MG testbed were conducted. Results show the reliability and the effectiveness of the proposed multiagent based RT-EMS. Various scenarios were tested such as normal operation as well as sudden load variation. The optimum values were obtained faster in terms of computation time as compared to existing techniques. The latency from the proposed system was 43% faster than other heuristic or deterministic methods in the literature. This significant improvement makes this proposed system more competitive for RT applications.",

    "Title": "AGENT-BASED MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION OF AIRCRAFT AT INTERSECTIONS",
    "Abstract": "This work presents a game-theoretic approach to address the problem of coordination and scheduling of aircraft at intersections, with the goal of avoiding conflicts and potential collisions. The proposed algorithm enables simple agents to work together in a way that leads to cooperative behaviors, resulting in equilibria that improve the overall efficiency of the system. We tested and compared the game-theoretic approach with a centralized approach, namely the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) principle, using data from Mohammed 5 Casablanca airport. The initial results suggest that the game-theoretic model is promising, despite its higher complexity. The approach has the potential to improve the overall coordination and scheduling of aircraft, leading to a more efficient and safe system. The proposed game-theoretic approach is designed to improve the coordination and scheduling of aircraft at intersections, ultimately leading to a safer and more efficient system. The approach is shown to be promising in initial testing, offering a potentially superior alternative to centralized approaches like FCFS. This research highlights the potential benefits of game-theoretic models in addressing complex coordination problems in multi-agent systems.",

    "Abstract": "Industries engaged in the perpetual production, consumption, and conservation of energy demand precise thermal-management methodologies. Additive manufacturing enables the production of intricate structures, broadening the scope of creating advanced heat exchangers. Triply Periodic Minimal Surface structures highlight exceptional thermos-physical properties, positioning them as prevalent choices in heat transfer. This study numerically investigates the flow and heat exchange mechanisms within a turbulent regime for a unique set of TPMS structures. Specifically, Fischer-Koch S (F-KS), PMY, and FRD heat exchangers were constructed with three-dimensional variable volume fractions in addition to the gyroid structure for comparison. This research includes a comprehensive examination of the overall thermal performance, including the fluid flow and heat transfer across the four TPMS models. Utilizing ANSYS-Fluent software as a CFD method, simulations were conducted to address the problem. The results provide a comprehensive database for devising heat exchangers employing previously unexplored TPMS configurations while scrutinizing the impacts of flow rate and volume fraction on TPMS performance. This knowledge imparts greater versatility to engineering applications for the design of heat exchangers that precisely fulfill the essential criteria for effective heat management.",

This concept aims to build teams of learners based on the complementarity of their skills, allowing flexible participation and offering interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities for all the learners. The success of this environment is related to predict efficient collaboration between the different teammates, allowing a smartly sharing knowledge in the Smart University environment.

To achieve that, this paper established a Konstanz Information Miner workflow that integrates the main steps for building and evaluating the RF classifier, this workflow is divided into: extracting knowledge from the smart collaborative learning ontology, calculating the completeness using a novel heuristic and building the RF classifier. Findings: The smart collaborative learning service enables efficient collaboration and democratized sharing of knowledge between learners, by using a semantic support decision support system.

    "Title": "Resilience assessment as a foundation for systems-of-systems safety evaluation: Application to an economic infrastructure",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, the authors propose two complementary approaches in an attempt to contribute to systems-of-systems (SoS) safety evaluation through resilience assessment. The first approach is a risk monitoring design, it is conceived to monitor, evaluate and analyze risks that represent destabilizations’ catalyzers. The second one is a structural analysis that begins with the estimation of criticality and frailty levels which leads to the calculation of failure impact and susceptibility measures of a component system on/to the SoS performance and process continuity. The combination of these approaches helps to assess SoS resilience through building a futurist, quantitative and anticipative perspective to evaluate the potential risks, their influences and impacts on SoS structure. Accordingly, this embraces a step towards safety forecast, evaluation and enhancement. A case study of a real-based economic infrastructure of a geographic area in France approached as a SoS model, is provided to experiment the proposition. The outcome of the presented approach's application shows that: (1) the use of the risk's monitoring dashboard helps to qualitatively illustrate risks striking the SoS or could possibly affect it in the future; (2) the structural analysis evaluates the impact of a component system's failure on the overall performance and efficiency of the SoS embracing it and vice versa; (3) the proposed approach could be used for anticipative and preventive reasons.",

    "Abstract": "3D Face recognition is being extensively recognized as a biometric performance refers to its non-intrusive environment. In spite of large research on 2-D face recognition, it suffers from low recognition rate due to illumination variations, pose changes, poor image quality, occlusions and facial expression variations, while 3D face models are insensitive to all these conditions. In this paper, we present an efficient 3D face recognition approach based on Geodesic Distance (GD) of Riemannian geometry and Random Forest (RF), named GD-FM+RF. Therefore, to compute the geodesic distance between the specified pairs of the points of 3D faces, we applied Fast Marching (FM) algorithm, in order to solve the Eikonal equation. Then, these extracted features presented by the geodesic facial curves are used by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to analyze class separability. Afterwards, these features were utilized as input of RF classifier. In order to test our approach and assess its effectiveness, simulated series of tests were implemented on 3D SHape REtrieval Contest 2008 database (SHREC'08). As a result, our proposed approach enhances the recognition rate and achieves promising results compared to state of the art methods, getting 99.11% in terms of recognition rate.",

Contrary to classic and heuristic-based routing strategies, the main goal of our proposition is that every peer prepares a database at the integration phase. The database includes information about peers, locations, routes to every destination, etc. Every peer possesses its own database and is able to update it whenever a change occurs in the system. Changes refer to the integration of new peers and the dissociation of existing ones. Theoretically, the communication between peers will become significa ntly quicker since every peer knows enough information about the other peers forming the system.

    "Abstract": "Generally, the face is one of the most important research, especially, face classification in pattern recognition. In this paper, based on the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptor and its Uniform Local Binary Pattern (ULBP) variant, we propose to merge a set of different descriptors features which consist of Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Global Discrete Cosine Transform (GDCT), and Local Discrete Cosine Transform (LDCT). First, we used ULBP, SLBP, and each previously mentioned techniques separately. Then, we combined them with LBP algorithm with two versions ULBP and SLBP. Afterward, we exploit them as an input of varied classification methods, as Polynomial-Support Vector Machine (Polynomial-SVM), RBF-SVM, Linear-SVM, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and AdaBoost. We evaluate the performance of our approach using two facial databases. The first one is BOSS. The second one is MIT-CBCL database. The experimental results reveal that the fusion features of LBP and HOG descriptors with SVM classifier exhibits robust performance in terms of accuracy and computation time in both databases, even if, the HOG achieved a good classification result when we used it alone with 99, 9% on BOSS database, which demonstrates the robustness of our database.",

    "Abstract": "Face detection is a crucial step in the process of Biometric systems. The aim of this work is to study some methods of feature extraction for face detection using Local Discrete Cosine Transform named LDCT, Global Discrete Cosine Transform named GDCT and Discrete Wavelet Transform called DWT using three different levels (2, 3 and 4), we have used each one separately and we have combined both of them to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, then comparison between these methods will be exposed. Our new proposed method aims to select feature from the extracted ones to reduce dimensionality, we have proceeded to select the significant features in face, like eyes mouth and nose. Finally, we applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate between two classes, faces and non-faces. We present experimental results applied on MIT face database to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel approach in terms of accuracy and running time.",

    "Title": "The Performance Improvement on 4-FB Face using Random Forest Classifier",
    "Abstract": "The growing demand in the field of security leads to the development of interesting approaches in face classification. For this reason, we bring a new method based on the extracted features of the four Frequency Blocks (4-FB) and Random Forest (RF) to classify faces and non faces, thus, we have used the fusion of three extracted features based on Discrete Cosines Transform (DCT), Uniform Local Binary Pattern (ULBP), and Histogram of Selected Regions (HSR), using RF classifier then, compared to other classifiers such as ID3, C4.5, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Neural Network (NN). Firstly, we have used each descriptor separately, secondly, we have combined the three descriptors in pairs and in trinomial, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Our new approach is to apply RF classifier only on local features, where, exhibits pertinent information about the face image as eyes, mouth, and nose which displays by four Frequency Blocks (4-FB). The performance of our proposed method was evaluated on our created database named BOSS. Moreover, RF classifier combined with DCT and ULBP provided better results with 4-FB compared to other used methods which exceeds 99%.",

    "Title": "A multiagent based decentralized energy management system for power exchange minimization in microgrid cluster",
    "Abstract": "Energy management system (EMS) is one of the pillars of next generation of power system called Smart Grid. More distributed generation (DG) produced from renewable energy (RE) will be injected into the distribution power system. EMS has the responsibility to manage this RE generation and conventional one to keep the power balance between generation and consumption. Different architectures of EMS could be found in literature: the centralized, decentralized and distributed. As the centralized architecture is becoming outdated, the decentralized one is the most promising step before implementing a fully distributed system. In this context, development of multiagent systems (MAS) and their tested proprieties increase researchers' interest in applying them in Microgrid (MG) context. This paper implements a decentralized multiagent EMS (DMA-EMS) that manages a MG cluster with fault tolerance feature. Within a single MG, a dedicated multiagent EMS that performs power dispatch with the objective of minimizing power exchange with the grid is implemented. Within the MG cluster, another dedicated EMS is implemented to share power between different MGs. Moreover, the DMA-EMS can manage active power support for the distribution feeder when needed. The implemented management system has proven its reliability and the effectiveness of the proposed management scheme in normal operation as well as in fault conditions through the multiagent JADE platform and Simulink model.",

    "Title": "Integrated circuit conception: A wire optimization technic reducing interconnection delay in advanced technology nodes",
    "Abstract": "As we increasingly use advanced technology nodes to design integrated circuits (ICs), physical designers and electronic design automation (EDA) providers are facing multiple challenges, firstly, to honor all physical constraints coming with cutting-edge technologies and, secondly, to achieve expected quality of results (QoR). An advanced technology should be able to bring better performances with minimum cost whatever the complexity. A high effort to develop out-of-the-box optimization techniques is more than needed. In this paper, we will introduce a new routing technique, with the objective to optimize timing, by only acting on routing topology, and without impacting the IC Area. In fact, the self-aligned double patterning (SADP) technology offers an important difference on layer resistance between SADP and No-SADP layers; this property will be taken as an advantage to drive the global router to use No-SADP less resistive layers for critical nets. To prove the benefit on real test cases, we will use Mentor Graphics’ physical design EDA tool Nitro-SoC™ and several 7 nm technology node designs. The experiments show that worst negative slack (WNS) and total negative slack (TNS) improved up to 13% and 56%, respectively, compared to the baseline flow.",

    "Title": "Security enhancement architectural model for IMS based networks",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is an architectural framework for delivering protocol-based services that enables an easy deployment of new rich multimedia services mixing voice and data. In fact, the IMS is vulnerable to several malicious uses that can be conducted by its users. We propose in this paper, a security enhancement architectural model to monitor the system and build a rapid and normal functioning retrieval after failing. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The weakness of the IMS network topology structure makes it a target for both normal cellular threats and IP-related threats. We propose a model that consists of dividing a complex set of end-of-end (IMS-based) network security related features into separate architectural components, layers and tiers in order to divide the system and to be more precise in the problems' detection phase. Findings: Using the proposed approach, an effective evaluation study is investigated. The simulated network adopting our model showed an excellent behavior. The quality metric measuring call quality showed some excellent results. In other words, the adoption of the proposed model does not affect the normal frame delays, packet arrival durations and packet loss rates. The results showed how our proposed model is lightweight and effective in handling security issues. Application/Improvements: This paper fulfills a huge need of handling security using an effective lightweight architectural model adopting the proposed approach. Our methodology ensures designing a secure, flexible and easily monitored network with a rapid location of the affected areas and effective security supervision.",

    "Abstract": "Nominal-contact-area analysis is combined with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy, and measurements of the scratch test critical load (Lc) to study interfacial properties in thin-film adhesion and heat transfer. This work complements an earlier investigation of the enhancement of adhesion strength and thermal contact resistance (Rc) produced by ion bombardment of the substrate surface before deposition. In this study, we have investigated Cu films deposited by radio-frequency sputtering onto alumina substrates. Extended ion bombardment etching leads to three related effects: the nominal contact area is increased significantly; Rc and Lc are decreased and increased respectively; XPS shows a greater penetration of the film material into the substrate and the formation of a complex interface. These results are interpreted as confirmation that ion bombardment leads to the formation of microcavities in the interface layer and, consequently, to increased adhesion strength and heat transfer by allowing mechanical interlocking between the film and the substrate.",

    "Abstract": "Adhesion and homogeneity of thin films are closely related to the physical and chemical subsurface properties. Thermal interface resistance characterizes the transition region and inhomogeneities. An original method of simultaneous measurement of the thermal interface resistance submicronic film-substrate and eftusivity of the substrate is presented. The measurement consists of analyzing the cooling phase which follows the temperature increase of the film by means of a short laser pulse (20 ns). The temperature is deduced from the electrical resistance of the film. The methodology uses a large analog bandwidth and a signal processing. In this way, the interface resistance as small as 10-8 m2 K. W-1 may be detected if the analysis is performed before the two microseconds. The effusivity characterizes a depth of a few μm into the substrate. The principle of the method and experimental arrangement are described. A theoretical model and a sensitivity analysis are presented. The experiments are on a copper-glass and copper-alumina microstructures. The effects of physical and chemical treatments are quantified. Measurements on thermal interface resistance are in the order of magnitude of 107 m2 K W-1 with an uncertainty of about 30%. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "Title": "A Blind Poisson–Gaussian Noise Separation Using Learning Copula Densities",
    "Abstract": "This paper develops a novel copula denoising optimization solution for separating Poisson noise from images, or removing mixtures of Poisson and Gaussian noise. The proposed approach is elaborated in two steps: first, a spatial bilateral total variation (BTV) regularization is used to reduce Gaussian noise; second, a learning copula procedure is employed to separate the Poisson noise from the ideal image. This leads to capture different image features while significantly reducing the noise. Analytically, we include results on the approximation of the Poisson component as well as the resolution of the proposed optimization model. In addition, to resolve the BTV minimization problem, we proposed an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Finally, numerical results are provided to remove noise while preserving important details and features, along with convincing comparisons to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. We show, in particular, that using a large database can improve the robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "Title": "A new method for the extraction of fetal ECG from the dependent abdominal signals using blind source separation and adaptive noise cancellation techniques",
    "Abstract": "Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that records the electrical activity of the heart, and depicts it as a series of graph-like tracings, or waves. Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one. Results: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance. Conclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases.",

Independent Component Analysis has been and is still used to solve the BSS problem; however, it is based on the mutual independence of the original source signals. In this paper, we propose to use Copulas to model the dependency structure between these signals, enabling the separation of dependent source components; we also deploy α-divergence as our cost function to minimize, considering its superiority to handle noisy data as well as its ability to converge faster. We test our approach for various values of alpha and give a comparative study between the proposed methodology and other existing methods; this approach exhibited a higher quality performance and accuracy, especially when the value of α is equal to 12, which is equivalent to the Hellinger divergence.",

Since the restoration step of super-resolution algorithms is always an ill-posed problem, the choice of the fidelity term and the regularization are always crucial. In this paper, we propose a new variational SR framework based on an automatic selection of the weighting parameter that control the balance between the L1 and L2 fidelity terms, which handle different type of noise distributions. Concerning the regularization, we use the combined total variation (TV) and the total variation of the first derivatives (TV2) model with a new implementation of the Primal-dual algorithm to solve the corresponding discretized problem. The obtained results are compared with some competitive algorithms and confirm that the proposed method has much benefices over the others in avoiding some undesirable artifacts.",

Our solution encompasses two fundamental steps. First, it employs a modified guided Total Variation (BTV) regularization method to effectively suppress Gaussian noise. Then, it implements a Hellinger distance copula separation procedure to separate the Poisson noise from the pristine image. This dual-step approach ensures that crucial image features are preserved while significantly reducing noise levels. The paper includes analytical findings related to approximating the Poisson noise component and successfully resolving the proposed optimization model within a well-defined framework. To tackle the challenge of BTV minimization, an efficient projected Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is introduced. The approach’s performance is demonstrated through comprehensive numerical experiments, illustrating noise reduction while maintaining essential image details and features.

When the estimation of motion is not well established, as usually happens for non-parametric motion, annoying artifacts appear in the super-resolved image. Since SR problems suffer from the motion and blur estimations, new techniques are considered to improve the registration and restoration steps. The proposed method consists of a non-parametric image registration based on diffusion regularization and a nonlocal Laplace regularizer combined with a bilateral filter (BTV) in the reconstruction step to remove noise and motion outliers. The diffusion registration is employed to handle the small deformation between the unregistered images, while the combination of nonlocal Laplace and BTV is used to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to the blurring effect and to the noise. We also prove the existence of a solution to the well posed registration problem.

Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in …",

    "Abstract": "The main idea of multi-frame super-resolution (SR) algorithm is to recover a single high-resolution (HR) image from a sequence of low resolution ones of the same scene. Since the restoration step of super-resolution algorithms is always an ill-posed problem, the choice of the fidelity term and the regularization are always crucial. In this paper, we propose a new variational SR framework based on an automatic selection of the weighting parameter that control the balance between the L1 and L2 fidelity terms, which handle different type of noise distributions. Concerning the regularization, we use the combined total variation (TV) and the total variation of the first derivatives (TV2) model with a new implementation of the Primal-dual algorithm to solve the corresponding discretized problem. The obtained results are compared with some competitive algorithms and confirm that the proposed method has much benefices …",

    "Abstract": "In the last few decades, digital image degradation issues, such as blur and noise due to the scanning process or the presence of spots, underwriting, overwriting or bleed-through/show-through effects on the image's background has been a popular research field. To solve this problem, many background removal methods has been introduced in the literature which are based on local or adaptive filters in order to deal with the low-contrast issue. For this paper, we will be focusing on the bleed-through/show-through effects, which is already resolved in literature by an analogy between the front-ground and the background of the image, that is to say, a recognition of two images is required. To fix that problem, we suggest a new restoration method using blind source separation based on copulas theory that models the dependency structure, with the aim of improving text readability and OCR efficiency.",

DCNN backpropagation is revealed to be characterised as an optimal control problem, where the state equation modelling DCNN forward propagation is an ordinary differential equation. In this article, by studying an optimal fractional control problem, we will develop a neural network whose weights are denoted by θ and named θ-FOCNet which models a generalisation of a DCNN network [21]. So, the aim of this work is to address the control problem θ-FOCNet for parameters learning in a new nonlinear model with a fractional Caputo derivative of order γ ∈ (0, 1) in time. To treat this problem, we first analyse the existence and uniqueness of the solution for a nonlinear fractional model (state equation) by using the Schaefer and Banach fixed points theorems, then we prove the existence of an optimal solution for the control problem. In addition, we introduce a non-smooth ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm for the numerical simulation of the computed free-noise image. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we present some numerical experiments and compare it with other competitive methods.",

Compared to the other partial differential equations (PDE) used in the SR context, the proposed super-resolution (SR) PDE can efficiently preserve image components such as corners and flat regions with less apparition of blur in homogeneous regions. Moreover, since the SR approaches are always ill-posed, a mathematical study of the existence and uniqueness of the solution is also checked in a Sobolev space. From the numerical experiments we can observe that the proposed PDE can efficiently improve the quality of the high-resolution (HR) image. Surprisingly, the apparition of blur in the restored image is less compared to the other methods. In addition to visual evaluation, two-based metrics are computed to confirm the improvements offered by the proposed PDE.",

    "Abstract": "This paper develops a novel copula denoising optimization solution for separating Poisson noise from images, or removing mixtures of Poisson and Gaussian noise. The proposed approach is elaborated in two steps: first, a spatial bilateral total variation (BTV) regularization is used to reduce Gaussian noise; second, a learning copula procedure is employed to separate the Poisson noise from the ideal image. This leads to capture different image features while significantly reducing the noise. Analytically, we include results on the approximation of the Poisson component as well as the resolution of the proposed optimization model. In addition, to resolve the BTV minimization problem, we proposed an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Finally, numerical results are provided to remove noise while preserving important details and features, along with convincing comparisons to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. We show, in particular, that using a large database can improve the robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

It has been extensively utilized in several recent vision problems, such as image denoising and deblurring. By incorporating recent developments in learning-based nonlinear diffusion models and highlighting the connection between partial differential equations (PDEs) and networks, especially residual networks, we propose a flexible learning reaction–diffusion system with spatially computed convolution kernels. This trained PDE is employed to prevent the low-level features from deteriorating, which is needed for tasks involving denoising. In fact, we introduce an improved network architecture for a denoising network entitled VPDNet through an optimal control problem. More precisely, the network architecture is governed by an explicit Euler discretization of a reaction–diffusion system. We give the main algorithm to identify the kernel parameters using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) combined with a Primal–Dual algorithm.

Since these parameters are always related to a better approximation of the image gradient and texture, their computation plays a major role in preserving the image features. Analytically, we include results on the approximation of these parameters as well as the resolution of the encountered bilevel problem in a suitable framework.

This choice uses the benefit from the classical high-order diffusion model of Perona-Malik type in the homogeneous regions, the Weickert model near sharp edges and also the BTV term in reducing blur. Since the super-resolution (SR) approaches are always considered as ill-posed problem, a mathematical study of the existence and uniqueness of the solution is then ensured in a convenient Sobolev space. Also, an alternative splitting scheme is adopted to reduce the high-order of the proposed PDE. Based on the numerical experiments, we can conclude that the proposed PDE can efficiently improve the quality of the HR image.

    "Title": "A weighted parameter identification PDE-constrained optimization for inverse image denoising problem",
    "Abstract": "This paper treats the inverse denoising problem which aims to compute simultaneously the clean image and the weighting parameter λ. The formulated denoising problem is posed using a partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization model. The minimized function imposes a Tikhonov regularization on the estimated λ, while the proposed PDE encompasses two high-order diffusive tensors. The particularity of this PDE is that it does not over-smooth homogeneous regions and preserves sharp edges during the denoising process, even if its degree is high. A new optimization procedure to compute the weighting parameter is also elaborated inspired from the nonsmooth Primal-dual algorithm. This leads to control of the diffusivity rate generated by the two diffusive operators. Finally, expressive results show that the computed spatial parameter λ leads to obtain a pleasant clean image. This is also confirmed by numerous comparisons with other competitive denoising approaches.",

Independent Component Analysis has been and is still used to solve the BSS problem; however, it is based on the mutual independence of the original source signals. In this paper, we propose to use Copulas to model the dependency structure between these signals, enabling the separation of dependent source components; we also deploy α-divergence as our cost function to minimize, considering its superiority to handle noisy data as well as its ability to converge faster. We test our approach for various values of alpha and give a comparative study between the proposed methodology and other existing methods; this approach exhibited a higher quality performance and accuracy, especially when the value of α is equal to 12, which is equivalent to the Hellinger divergence.",

In this paper, we propose a new variational SR framework based on an automatic selection of the weighting parameter that control the balance between the L1 and L2 fidelity terms, which handle different type of noise distributions. Concerning the regularization, we use the combined total variation (TV) and the total variation of the first derivatives (TV2) model with a new implementation of the Primal-dual algorithm to solve the corresponding discretized problem.

The proposed model generalizes and improves the nonvariational model of Halim and Kumar (2020). Our model is based on a diffusion tensor that improves the behavior of the Perona–Malik diffusion directions in homogeneous regions and the Weickert model near tiny edges with a high diffusion order. The proposed approach takes into consideration the best of regularized Perona–Malik process in flat regions, and the benefit of the Weickert filter effect near sharp edges. To overcome the difficulty of the 4th order in the proposed equation, we involve the decomposition approach of H−1 norm suggested by Guo et al. (2011) [20, 21] to transform it into coupled second order equations which is more appropriate to represent the small details in the textured image. By the Schauder method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution of the proposed reaction–diffusion System.

In this paper, we propose a new configuration of genetic algorithms to resolve the super-resolution problem using a Non-Local Means filter as a denoiser function with a rigorous proof of the existence of a unique minimizer. In fact, since the SR algorithms always skip the complex spatial interactions within images, a more consistent model is then needed.

    "Title": "A new method for the extraction of fetal ECG from the dependent abdominal signals using blind source separation and adaptive noise cancellation techniques",
    "Abstract": "Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that records the electrical activity of the heart, and depicts it as a series of graph-like tracings, or waves. Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one. Results: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance. Conclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases.",

Multi-frame super-resolution image reconstruction is frequently used in various image-processing tools, where the aim is to reconstruct highresolution images from their corresponding low-resolution (LR) sequences. The resolution means the number of pixels per unit area. Then an HR image has a larger pixel number compared with a LR one.

Since the parameter p is always related to a better approximation of the image gradient, its computation plays a critical role in preserving the image texture.

In addition, to resolve the PDE-constrained minimization problem, we proposed a modified primal-dual algorithm.

The proposed PDE can not only preserve singularities and edges while smoothing, but also can keep safe the texture much better. This PDE is based on the nonlocal setting of the anisotropic diffusion behavior by constructing a nonlocal term of Weickert type, which is known by its coherence enhancing diffusion tensor properties. A mathematical study concerning the well-posedness of the nonlocal PDE is also investigated with an appropriate choice of the functional space. This PDE has demonstrated its efficiency by combining the diffusion process of Perona-Malik in the flat regions and the anisotropic diffusion of the Weickert model near strong edges, as well as the ability of the non-local term to preserve the texture. The elaborated experimental results give a great insight into the effectiveness of the proposed nonlocal PDE compared to some PDEs, visually and quantitatively.\n1. Introduction. The need for high-resolution (HR) images in various practical applications continues to rise day after day. Indeed, to see or detect fine details in a given image, the resolution plays a critical role; more the resolution is large more the image details are clear. For instance, in medical imaging, HR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must be at high resolution to facilitate the analysis or diagnosis made by doctors. Otherwise, to recognize a vehicle license plate or criminal face, the police need to zoom some parts of the image or video, which requires a large resolution. However, the hardware limitations and the very expensive price that hardware components require …",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a stable numerical implementation of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid image registration, based on a finite volume scheme. Although fluid registration methods have succeeded in handling large deformations in various applications, they still suffer from perturbed solutions due to the choice of the numerical implementation. Thus, a robust numerical scheme in the optimization step is required to enhance the quality of the registration. A key challenge is the use of a finite volume-based scheme, since we have to deal with a hyperbolic equation type. We propose the classical Patankar scheme based on pressure correction, which is called Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equation (SIMPLE). The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested on magnetic resonance images of the human brain and hands, and compared with the classical implementation of the fluid image registration [13], in which the authors used a successive overrelaxation in the spatial domain with Euler integration in time to handle the nonlinear viscous. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, visually and quantitatively, using the differences between images criteria, PSNR and SSIM measures.\n1. Introduction. Image registration is one of today’s most challenging problems in image processing, its main object being to find geometrical correspondences between two images or more, which we call the reference and the template [9, 39, 31, 10, 19, 45, 44].

Image denoising is mandatory as a preprocessing step in different areas such as medical, military, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ultrasound images. Images can be contaminated by noise in the process of acquisition due to environmental conditions and the process of transmission and processing. The purpose of image denoising is to build a clean image from a noisy input one. Obtaining such images requires that every pixel can be expressed as a function of the noise. In this context the multiplicative noise model expresses the observed image as a product of the noise and the original image:",

This is related, in fact, to the used numerical scheme which does not take into consideration the different properties of the continuous operators. To take into account these properties, we use a robust numerical scheme based on finite volume with pressure correction. This scheme, which is called by the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equation-Consistent (SIMPLEC), is known for its stability and consistency in fluid dynamics context.

This choice uses the benefit from the classical high-order diffusion model of Perona-Malik type in the homogeneous regions, the Weickert model near sharp edges and also the BTV term in reducing blur. Since the super-resolution (SR) approaches are always considered as ill-posed problem, a mathematical study of the existence and uniqueness of the solution is then ensured in a convenient Sobolev space. Also, an alternative splitting scheme is adopted to reduce the high-order of the proposed PDE.

Moreover, based on some density arguments, some a priori estimates and using the Galerkin approach, we prove existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the nonlocal wave equation. 1. Introduction. The study of nonlocal problems has gained great attention over the last two decades. Nonlocal models involve integral equations and fractional derivatives allowing nonlocal interactions, that is to say, the interaction may occur even when the closures of two domains have an empty intersection. Such models are effective in modeling material singularities and are widely considered in a variety of applications, including image analyses [6]-[10], phase transition [4][11], machine learning [12] and obstacle problem [5]... In a major advance in 2013, Du et al. [3] introduced nonlocal vector calculus as a nonlocal framework to understand and analyze nonlocal problems. It defines non-local fluxes , nonlocal analogues of the gradient, divergence, and curl operators, and presentes some basic nonlocal integral theorems that mimic the classical integral theorems of the vector calculus for differential operators, the authors have also provided connection between the nonlocal operators and their usual differential counterparts in a distributional sense then in a weak sense by introducing nonlocal weighted operators. The present paper was motivated by [2], where the authors threw light on the analogy between nonlocal and local diffusion …",

Subsequently, we apply a primal-dual method to effectively navigate the non-differentiability of the cost function. In tandem with theoretical advancements, we rigorously establish the stability of the solution, particularly in the presence of noisy data, ensuring convergence.

Attackers use different means to disrupt services, these various attacks push to think of a new way to block them all in one manner. In addition, these intrusions can change and penetrate the devices of security. To solve these issues, we suggest, in this paper, a new idea for Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to recognize menaces and to obtain a long-term memory on them, in order to stop the new attacks that are like the existing ones, and at the same time, to have a single mean to block intrusions.

    "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast-growing paradigm in on-going research fields and industrial domains that includes wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, big data, smart cities, large-scale industrial IoT services, etc. In the Internet of Things architecture, wireless sensor networks can be an important factor in optimizing IoT solutions. This architecture includes various gateways, controllers, application servers, and IoT clouds. In many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, messages may need to be distributed to a specific set of objects or nodes using the multicast communication mode. Existing IoT multicast routing algorithms are not performant or efficient enough to support multimedia group-based applications in an IoT context since they are primarily focused on ad hoc sensor networking scenarios. In this paper, we propose MSDN-IoT, a novel multicast software-defined network based on a hierarchical shared multicast tree, and a flexible set of SDN controller modules, like group management for dynamic multicast services. Our results show the effectiveness of our protocol over state-of-the-art protocols in terms of end-to-end delay, end-to-end delay-variation, scalability, and other metrics.",

    "Abstract": "Ensuring the robustness, security, and privacy of machine learning is a pivotal objective, crucial for unlocking the complete potential of the internet of things (IoT). Deep neural networks have proven to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible to humans. These perturbations can give rise to adversarial attacks, leading to erroneous predictions by deep neural networks, particularly in intrusion detection within the IoT environment. This paper introduces a federated adversarial learning framework designed to protect both data privacy and deep neural network models. This framework consists of federated learning for data privacy and adversarial training on IoT devices to enhance model robustness. The experiments show that adversarial training at the Fog node devices significantly improves the robustness of a federated learning model against adversarial attacks when compared to normal training. Furthermore, the proposed adversarial deep federated learning model is validated using the Edge-IIoTset dataset, achieving an accuracy rate of 91.23% in the detection of attacks.",

    "Abstract": "The Internet of things (IoT) has evolved significantly, automating daily activities by connecting numerous devices. However, this growth has increased cybersecurity threats, compromising data integrity. To address this, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been developed, mainly using predefined attack patterns. With rising cyber-attacks, improving IDS effectiveness is crucial, and machine learning is a key solution. This research enhances IDS capabilities by introducing binary attack identification and multiclass attack categorization for IoT traffic, aiming to improve IDS performance. Our framework uses the ‘BoT-IoT’ and ‘TON-IoT’ datasets, which include various IoT network traffic and cyber-attack scenarios, such as DDoS and data infiltration, to train machine learning and ensemble models. Specifically, it combines three machine learning models-decision tree, resilient backpropagation (RProp) multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression-into ensemble methods like voting and stacking to improve prediction accuracy and reduce detection errors. These ensemble classifiers outperform individual models, demonstrating the benefit of diverse learning techniques. Our framework achieves high accuracy, with 99.99% for binary classification on the BoT-IoT dataset and 97.31% on the ToN-IoT dataset.

    "Title": "Enhancing malware detection capabilities using deep learning with advanced hyperparameter tuning",
    "Abstract": "As the threat landscape evolves with sophisticated malware and advanced persistent threats (APTs), the need for effective detection solutions increases. Traditional methods, such as signature-based and heuristic analysis, struggle to keep up with rapidly changing malicious activities. While machine learning offers a promising approach, it often falls short due to the manual extraction and selection of features, leading to time-consuming and error-prone processes. This research introduces a novel malware detection solution leveraging deep learning and focusing on portable executable (PE) file analysis to address these weaknesses. By customizing the hyperparameters of artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), the proposed approach enhances detection capabilities. The primary objective is to overcome the limitations of traditional and machine learning methods by tailoring these deep learning algorithms. The methodology includes a comparative study to demonstrate the advantages of the customized approach over conventional methods.

This study examines 201 decisions selected from a pool of 562, released between 1999 and 2018, pertaining to corporate tax and involving 550 disputes spanning various corporate tax classifications. The paper aims to propose latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and compare it with our previous results obtained from the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model. The findings suggest that the rulings can be classified into two primary classifications: those that uphold or reject the tax administration's position. The proposed model shows a good performance, achieving a precision of 9.25% and an accuracy of 9.51%.

Identifying and preventing these attacks can be challenging, as they frequently rely on manipulating human behavior rather than exploiting technical vulnerabilities. Although various studies have explored SE attacks and their defense mechanisms, there remains a gap in the literature concerning the holistic and layered classification of these threats and countermeasures. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive literature survey to understand existing taxonomies and subsequently identified areas that required a more structured and exhaustive categorization. Based on the survey results, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of SE attacks, classifying them based on three levels: environment, approaches, and mediums. Additionally, we present a taxonomy of social engineering countermeasures, encompassing both technical and non-technical solutions. The proposed taxonomies serve as a foundation for future research and offer organizations a valuable framework for developing effective strategies to detect, prevent, and respond to social engineering incidents.",

    "Title": "Fine-Tuned Understanding: Enhancing Social Bot Detection with Transformer-Based Classification",
    "Abstract": "In recent years, the proliferation of online communication platforms and social media has given rise to a new wave of challenges, including the rapid spread of malicious bots. These bots, often programmed to impersonate human users, can infiltrate online communities, disseminate misinformation, and engage in various activities detrimental to the integrity of digital discourse. It is becoming more and more difficult to discern a text produced by deep neural networks from that created by humans. Transformer-based Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have recently shown excellent results in challenges involving natural language understanding (NLU). The suggested method is to employ an approach to detect bots at the tweet level by utilizing content and fine-tuning PLMs, to reduce the current threat. Building on the recent developments of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT-3, the suggested model employs a text embedding approach. This method offers a high-quality representation that can enhance the efficacy of detection. In addition, a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) was used on top of the PLMs for final classification. The model was experimentally evaluated using the Twitter bot dataset. The strategy was tested using test data that came from the same distribution as their training set. The methodology in this paper involves preprocessing Twitter data, generating contextual embeddings using PLMs, and designing a classification model that learns to differentiate between human users and bots. Experiments were carried out adopting advanced Language Models to construct an encoding of the tweet to create a potential input vector on top of BERT and their variants. By employing Transformer-based models, we achieve significant improvements in bot detection F1-score (93%) compared to traditional methods such as Word2Vec and Global Vectors for Word Representation (Glove). Accuracy improvements ranging from 3% to 24% compared to baselines were achieved. The capability of GPT-4, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM), in interpreting bot-generated content is examined in this research. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) was utilized alongside transformer-based models for detecting bots on social media, enhancing the transparency and reliability of these models.",

However, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the effective recognition of complex scripts, such as Arabic, in real-time applications. This research aims to bridge this gap by leveraging TinyML for the accurate recognition of Arabic numbers and simple letters through gesture-based air handwriting. For the first time, we introduce a novel tiny deep learning (TinyDL) model that utilizes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically designed to handle the intricacies of the Arabic script and adaptable for the TinyML domain. Despite the widespread use of CNNs in gesture recognition, our model stands out by achieving an exceptional accuracy rate of 97.5% in decoding 2D gesture inputs of Arabic numerals and letters. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of our TinyDL model in addressing the unique challenges posed by Arabic script recognition, thereby making it a user-friendly and accessible solution. Moreover, our research contributes to the advancement of TinyML applications in real-world gesture recognition apps, showcasing the potential of TinyML in transforming the interaction between humans and digital devices.",

Current Red Teaming practices often lack adaptability and efficiency in simulating sophisticated, evolving attack vectors, creating a gap in assessing real-world organizational vulnerabilities. This study introduces an AI-driven framework utilizing LLMs, such as ShellGPT, to enhance Red Teaming exercises by providing dynamic, context-aware suggestions across critical stages, from reconnaissance to exploitation, and even to the generation of the pentest report. Tested on a virtualized network mimicking real-world condition, LLMs demonstrated increased adaptability and improved the precision of attack simulations, enabling teams to emulate advanced adversarial techniques more effectively. The research also contributes a novel penetration testing model that integrates LLMs, addressing challenges such as operational scalability and sophisticated threat emulation. This approach not only elevates the quality of Red Teaming reports but also equips cybersecurity teams with advanced tools to anticipate and mitigate evolving threats.

    "Abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for distributed training of deep neural networks within Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where the data generated by IoT devices stays local, and only model updates are communicated to a central server. This methodology is particularly relevant for intrusion detection systems in IoT networks, where security is paramount. However, the decentralized nature of FL introduces vulnerabilities, such as the risk of data poisoning by malicious participants. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning to reduce communication overhead and improve privacy by limiting data spread. We further explore the impact of label-flipping attacks on hierarchical FL systems used in IoT-based intrusion detection. We focus on scenarios where a subset of malicious participants attempts to degrade the global model’s performance by submitting corrupted model updates based on intentionally mislabeled data. Our findings reveal significant decreases in classification accuracy by 10.53% and recall rates, even with a minimal number of compromised participants, primarily affecting the specific classes targeted by the attackers. We further examine how the availability of these malicious nodes influences the attack’s success. To counteract these threats, we introduce a defense mechanism that successfully identifies all malicious clients and mitigates their impact. As a result, the global model’s accuracy is maintained at the original 95% level found during training without the presence of malicious clients, thereby enhancing the resilience of federated learning models in IoT security applications.",

SOC analysts’ performance evaluation remains problematic due to the choice of the performance metrics and their inadequacy with the SOC socio-technical system.

AR is one of the ultra-reliable low latency communications since it requires a total delay of about 5 ms for AR applications. Since mobile devices are battery-operated and have many limitations in computing resources, i.e., processing, storage, and energy, computing tasks associated with mobile AR applications have to be offloaded to nearby devices with sufficient computing resources. To this end, this paper provides a system structure for mobile AR and web-based AR applications; based on the modified multi-level mobile edge computing system (MM-MEC). Furthermore, the required offloading algorithms for managing data offloading from mobile devices to edge servers are introduced. The algorithms are latency and energy-aware, as the selection of the executing device for the AR computing tasks achieves the highest energy and latency efficiency. The proposed structure and offloading techniques have been validated through simulation processes. The developed framework and the proposed offloading schemes have been simulated over a reliable environment for various simulation The suggested system and its offloading methods were simulated in a dependable environment for a number of simulation situations.",

    "Title": "Towards a federated and hybrid cloud computing environment for sustainable and effective provisioning of cyber security virtual laboratories",
    "Abstract": "Cloud Computing (CC) and virtualization concepts are two advanced technologies introduced to empower distance and blended learning. Besides, they play a crucial role in equipping learners with practical skills and fostering hands-on experience to defend against cyber-attacks. Many Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in developed countries have already embraced the promise of CC to raise educational standards. However, the pace of its adoption in developing countries has stagnated. Moreover, existing solutions in the literature are not sustainable. They either rely on on-premise infrastructure or are bound by a single cloud service provider. Consequently, they are likely prone to failures and a sudden outage. To fill this gap, this paper is a first that comprehensively addresses the above issues and introduces a federated hybrid CC system based on an extension of Apache Virtual Computing Lab (VCL). The proposed system provides an independent open-source implementation, greater configuration flexibility, and methodological improvements as compared to existing studies in the literature. In addition, it promotes the sustainability of the CC services, extensible cloud architecture, and fault tolerance. VCL is primarily focused on provisioning Virtual Laboratories (VL) for remote cybersecurity and computer networks education, with potential expansion to other domains of engineering education. In addition, this paper introduces GPT-TerminalPro, a terminal-based tool driven by OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT-3.5) that provides intelligent assistance to users while performing lab tasks. To experimentally evaluate the VCL's performance, the standard Linux tools as well as the Apache benchmark and httperf HTTP load generators are utilized. VCL has been tested with 30 users and 61 virtual user computing environments provisioning to validate the overall performance. The results are fascinating: the provisioning time including all VCL background tasks is always less than a minute and utilizes fewer computing resources while providing a better user experience. This paper will encourage the adoption of CC in low-income countries.",

    "Title": "A systematic review of cybersecurity assessment methods for HTTPS",
    "Abstract": "Cybersecurity assessments are critical for ensuring that security measures in organizational infrastructures, systems, and applications meet necessary requirements. Given the significant HTTPS vulnerabilities exposed in recent years, assessing HTTPS deployments is increasingly important. However, there has been no systematic literature review (SLR) comparing different cybersecurity assessment methods specifically for HTTPS deployment security issues. This study aims to address this gap by identifying, analyzing, and comparing various HTTPS deployment assessment methods documented in scientific literature. Our approach involved a structured research methodology with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting relevant methods. The review utilizes 16 comparison metrics, divided into two categories: critical security metrics, focusing on assessment metrics adopted and the number of vulnerabilities evaluated by each method, and additional metrics assessing the methods’ applicability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The findings indicate varied adoption rates of these metrics among the reviewed cybersecurity assessment methods, highlighting the absence of a standardized approach using common, well-defined security metrics for HTTPS deployment assessment. In contrast, merging all the comparison metrics outlined in this review would enable a more in-depth assessment of HTTPS deployment security issues, enhance the quality of reported results, and lead to the development of a more practical assessment method.",

    "Abstract": "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has revolutionized network management by providing unprecedented flexibility, control, and efficiency. However, its centralized architecture introduces critical security vulnerabilities. This paper introduces a novel approach to securing SDN environments using IOTA 2.0 smart contracts. The proposed system utilizes the IOTA Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, to improve scalability and efficiency while eliminating transaction fees and reducing energy consumption. We introduce three smart contracts: Authority, Access Control, and DoS Detector, to ensure trusted and secure network operations, prevent unauthorized access, maintain the integrity of control data, and mitigate denial-of-service attacks. Through comprehensive simulations using Mininet and the ShimmerEVM IOTA Test Network, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing SDN security. Our findings highlight the potential of IOTA 2.0 smart contracts to provide a robust, decentralized solution for securing SDN environments, paving the way for the further integration of blockchain technologies in network management.",

    "Title": "Impact of emotional intelligence on the stress and safety of construction workers' in Saudi Arabia",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: In a country like Saudi Arabia, where the construction industry is witnessing an impressive growth in the post-oil era, it is important to examine the occupational health and safety behaviors of construction workers (CWs). Design/methodology/approach: The present study aims to investigate the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) on workers' stress and safety behaviors. Data were collected from CWs (n = 265) at a major construction site in the city of Jeddah. Two questionnaires comprising 25 and 32 questions were used to measure their EI and stress levels, respectively. Furthermore, structured interviews were conducted with the managers and supervisors to inquire about the safety behavior of their respective workers. Descriptive statistics, simple and companion regression were used for data analysis. Findings: The findings indicate that EI plays an important role to enhance the safety behaviors of the CWs besides reducing their workplace stresses. Furthermore, workers' stress levels are found to negatively impact their safety behaviors, indicating that any reduction in occupational stress can reciprocally enhance their safety compliance. The findings are further discussed with the concerned stakeholders to recommend a seven-point therapeutic role of EI for the safety of CWs. Originality/value: Results of the study can be used by managers and supervisors of the Saudi construction industry to reduce workplace accidents and improve the productivity of their organizations.",

    "Title": "A TinyML model for sidewalk obstacle detection: aiding the blind and visually impaired people",
    "Abstract": "This paper presents a pioneering study on the feasibility of implementing deep learning on resource-restricted IoT devices for real-world applications. We introduce a TinyML model configured for sidewalk obstacle detection tailored explicitly to assist those with visual impairments-a demographic often hindered by urban navigation challenges. Our investigation primarily focuses on adapting traditionally computationally intensive deep learning models to the stringent confines of IoT systems, where both memory and processing power are markedly limited. With a remarkably small footprint of just 1.93 MB and a robust mean average precision (mAP) of 50%, the proposed model achieves breakthrough outcomes, making it particularly well-suited for lightweight IoT devices. We demonstrate an exceptional inference speed of 96.2 milliseconds on a standard CPU, signifying a substantial step toward real-time processing in assistive technologies. The implications of this research are profound, emphasizing TinyML’s potential to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning capabilities and the accessibility demands of assistive devices for visually impaired individuals.",

    "Title": "A Novel Secure and Privacy-Preserving Model for OpenID Connect Based on Blockchain",
    "Abstract": "OpenID Connect (OIDC) is one of the most widely used delegated authentication protocols in web and mobile applications providing a single sign-on experience. It allows third-party applications, called Relying Parties (RP), to securely request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users from an identity provider. The OIDC specification defines several parameters, including the client_id, client_secret, authorization code, access token, id token, state, and redirect_uri, as keys to the protocol operation, with significant security and privacy implications. Therefore, securing these parameters is critical to prevent attackers from impersonating legitimate entities, gaining unauthorized access, having complete control over users' accounts, and/or violating their privacy. To enhance OIDC security and preserve its users' privacy, we propose a novel model for OIDC based on the Ethereum Blockchain and the non-fungible token (ERC721) standard. To prove the robustness and safety of the proposed system, we perform a detailed security analysis formally using the most widely accepted protocols security verification tools, AVISPA and Scyther, and informally by discussing various attacks. The analysis results show that the proposed system is resilient against well-known attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate the cost and performance of the proposed solution, confirming its affordability and assuring that our approach does not impact the user experience and performance of existing OIDC-based systems. Finally, we conduct a security and privacy comparative analysis with similar existing systems, proving the superiority and efficiency of our proposed Blockchain-based OIDC system.",

    "Title": "Fan Fault Diagnosis Using Acoustic Emission and Deep Learning Methods",
    "Abstract": "The modern conception of industrial production recognizes the increasingly crucial role of maintenance. Currently, maintenance is thought of as a service that aims to maintain the efficiency of equipment and systems while also taking quality, energy efficiency, and safety requirements into consideration. In this study, a new methodology for automating the fan maintenance procedures was developed. An approach based on the recording of the acoustic emission and the failure diagnosis using deep learning was evaluated for the detection of dust deposits on the blades of an axial fan. Two operating conditions have been foreseen: No-Fault, and Fault. In the No-Fault condition, the fan blades are perfectly clean while in the Fault condition, deposits of material have been artificially created. Utilizing a pre-trained network (SqueezeNet) built on the ImageNet dataset, the acquired data were used to build an algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The transfer learning applied to the images of the spectrograms extracted from the recordings of the acoustic emission of the fan, in the two operating conditions, returned excellent results (accuracy = 0.95), confirming the excellent performance of the methodology.",

    "Title": "Blockchain-Based Traceability for Shipping Containers in Unimodal and Multimodal Logistics",
    "Abstract": "An unprecedented amount of goods and commodities are shipped and transported globally each day through different modes of transport. Due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust and secure ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation. These shortcomings are reflected in cargo processing delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. Most of today's systems and technologies leveraged for managing shipping containers in unimodal and multimodal logistics fall short of providing transparency, traceability, reliability, audit, security, and trust features. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that allows users to trace and track their container shipments in a manner that is decentralized, transparent, auditable, secure, and trustworthy. We employ the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to overcome the limited data storage problem. We develop smart contracts and present algorithms along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details in both unimodal and multimodal logistics. We present security and cost analyses to show that the proposed solution is secure and cost-efficient. Furthermore, we compare our proposed solution with the existing solutions to show its novelty. All developed smart contract codes are made publicly available on GitHub.",

    "Title": "Secure Software Defined Networks Controller Storage using Intel Software Guard Extensions",
    "Abstract": "The SDN controller is the core of the software-defined network (SDN), which provides important network operations that needs to be protected from all type of threats. Many researches have been focusing on different layers of security regarding the SDN controller such as Anti-DDOS system or enforcement of TLS connection between the controller and the Open-vswitches. One of the major security threats targeting any program is the environment execution itself (e.g. Operating system and the hardware itself). Intel's Software Guard Extension (SGX) offers a sloid layer of security applied to applications by creating a Trusted execution environment. SDN controller relay on a storage module to keep sensitive data such as Flow Rules, users’ credentials and configuration files. Protecting this side of the SDN controller is a must in term of security. To date, no work has been conducted considering SDN controller storage security using Intel SGX. This paper introduces an SGX enabled SDN controller. The new controller ensures the integrity and the confidentiality in a trusted execution environment by leveraging a recent hardware technology called intel SGX. This technology provides a trusted and secure enclave. Enclaves are sealed and unsealed by intel SGX attestation mechanisms to protect the executed code and data inside live memory and disk from being altered by any unauthorized access. High privileged codes such as the OS itself is kept from altering data inside enclaves. We implemented the Intel SGX using the Floodlight SDN controller running a real enabled Intel SGX hardware. Our evaluation shows that the SGX enabled SDN controller introduces a slightly observable performance overhead to the floodlight controller compared to advantages in term of security.",

    "Title": "Performance analysis of 6LoWPAN protocol for a flood monitoring system",
    "Abstract": "The internet of things is a disruptive technology that has been applied as a solution to problems in many fields of monitoring environmental variables. It is supported by technologies such as wireless sensor networks, which offer many protocols and hardware platforms in the market today. Protocols such as 6LoWPAN are novel, so this work focuses on determining whether its implementation on TelosB mote is feasible; these would be placed on an experimental deployment for a particular scenario of flash floods in a sector known as “La Brigada”, in the city of Barranquilla. This proposal has not been evaluated in Colombia for this type of application, and no similar work has been done for this type of scenario. For the evaluation of 6LoWPAN, a deployment with two end nodes and a sink node has been designed, due to the monitoring section under study; 5-min tests are proposed where through round trip time traffic PINGv6 packets are generated back and forth (Echo) between a sink node and two end nodes. The results are based on the evaluation of metrics such as delay and ping packet request/response rate. The performance of these metrics is subject to test scenarios that vary according to distance, packet size, and channel scan time. Two routing options, static or dynamic, are also proposed for this application case. The tests performed yielded results in terms of better performance in the test scenarios for packets with an average size of 120 B and channel monitoring times of 1024 ms. Likewise, the use of the TelosB platform was validated as a viable and innovative option for a monitoring scenario to flash floods in short stretches of the city of Barranquilla—Colombia. This study is important because it can provide information on the use of the TelosB platform as a valid solution for similar application scenarios; furthermore, the tests performed can be replicated in similar studies to evaluate congestion, power consumption, routing, topologies, and other metrics. This study is providing a road map for the research community to follow the simulation scenario to apply the test to their own studies. This work also provides the guidelines for similar researchers to monitor the flood in their own regions and then compare their results with this study.",

    "Title": "AI-enabled digital forgery analysis and crucial interactions monitoring in smart communities",
    "Abstract": "Digital forgery has become one of the attractive research fields in today's technology. There are several types of forgery in digital media transmission, especially digital image transmission. A common type of forgery is copy-move forgery (CMF). The CMF may be encountered in streets, railway stations, underground stations, or festivals. This type of forgery may lead to hugger-mugger in some cases. Therefore, there is a need to find a sufficient countermeasure mechanism to detect image forgeries. This paper presents a new CMFD approach that depends on deep learning for IoT based smart cities. Two well-known deep learning models, namely CNN and ConvLSTM, are adopted for CMFD. The proposed models are tested on MICC-220, MICC-600 and MICC 2000 datasets for validation. Several tests are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models. The simulation results reveal that the testing accuracy reaches 95%, 73%, and 94% for MICC-F220, MICC-F600 and MICC-F2000 datasets. In addition, the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 85% for a combined set of all datasets.",

    "Abstract": "The Internet of Things has profoundly modified the usual vision of protocols, particularly in terms of energy constraints. Low-power sensor networks are now one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things, where sensors will play a significant role in the future internet by collecting the surrounding context and environment information. Security is one of the most challenges in this type of network. The existing solutions proposed to secure communication in wireless networks are not suitable. The contribution of this paper is to reduce the cost of communication of the datagram transport layer security protocol DTLS and to improve the weakness of the cookies exchange in the handshake process against deny of service attacks. The proposed enhanced cryptography protocol is integrated into the constrained application protocol to reduce the cost in terms of messages and size taken by the security layer in each message. The evaluation of the proposed protocol is performed on the Contiki operating system, for the internet of things, and compared with the original version of the DTLS protocol. The results show that the enhanced DTLS protocol offers a good performance in comparison with the original version of the protocol in terms of packet overhead, handshake time duration, and energy consumption.",

    "Title": "Towards to intelligent routing for DTN protocols using machine learning techniques",
    "Abstract": "The communication protocols of wireless networks have experienced great advances in recent years, specifically with the evolution of new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). However, certain problems remain unsolved, in particular for wireless networks, and more specifically for DTN networks, which represent a major challenge in terms of DTN routing. This paper aims to design an intelligent routing system based on machine learning techniques, the use of which represents another possibility to classify bundles that have arrived at the destination successfully or not. These networks occasionally carry out an evaluation which makes it possible to choose the type of routing corresponding to a given situation. It then minimizes the unnecessary information of the entries and performs the classification of the data. Despite the problems cited, our challenge is to design an intelligent routing mechanism that is able to classify bundles that have arrived and those that have not arrived at their destination. The smart routing system uses machine learning as a main tool to design our system. Indeed, various Machine Learning techniques, such as Bagging and Boosting, have been used to classify whether bundles have arrived at their destination successfully or not. Machine Learning now enables us to learn directly from data rather than human expertise, resulting in higher accuracy. We utilized the SMOTE technique to balance the two groups of data, which allows us to collect the equal amount of samples for each class. We also included techniques for interpreting complicated Machine Learning Models to understand the reasoning for model decisions, such as SHAP values. Results show an overall accuracy of 80% for the Random Forest (RF) and ExtraTrees Classifier (ET).",

    "Title": "A MATURITY FRAMEWORK FOR CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE IN ORGANIZATIONS",
    "Abstract": "Digitalization necessarily leads organizations to rethink their cybersecurity principles in order to counter all the risks inherent in cybercrime. Cybersecurity governance brings together all the essential elements of cyber defense and effective risk management. Without such governance, dangerous gaps persist, and assets are inevitably compromised. Given the critical decisions that need to be made in an ever-changing cyber threat environment, cybersecurity standards are a critical way for companies to ensure that their security strategy and policies are consistently and measurably implemented. The aim of this paper is to propose a capability maturity framework to assess and improve cybersecurity governance in organizations. The finding will help organizations to evaluate their cybersecurity governance capabilities.",

    "Title": "Study and Analysis of Multiconnectivity for Ultrareliable and Low-Latency Features in Networks and V2X Communications",
    "Abstract": "Ultrareliable and low-latency connection (URLLC) is one of the novel features in 5G networks and subsequent generations, in which it targets to fulfill stringent requirements on data rates, reliability, and availability. Moreover, the multiconnectivity concept is introduced to meet these requirements, where multiple different technologies are connected simultaneously, and the data packet is duplicated and transmitted from multiple transmitters. To this end, in this paper, we present an analysis, model, and method to ensure the reliability of data delivery when organizing URLLC in 5G networks. In addition, a new approach based on the organization of multiple connections (multiconnectivity) and duplication of transmitted data is considered. Further, an analytical model is presented for assessing the probability of failure, taking into account the traffic intensity, the probability of failure of elements, and the number of used connections. Moreover, an efficient method is proposed for increasing the reliability of data delivery by optimizing the number of connections. Further, a multiconnectivity-based URLLC model has been built for evaluating the proposed method and verifies that the optimal number of routes for data delivery between the user and the point of service can be obtained, where the probability of losses and equipment reliability are jointly considered. Finally, detailed analysis of results shown that with \"equal\"routes in terms of load (with an equally probable traffic distribution) and the probability of equipment failure, the optimal number of routes can be found, at which the minimum probability of losses is achieved.",

    "Title": "Flexible architecture for deployment of edge computing applications",
    "Abstract": "Recently, a great development has occurred in the communication networks, in which the trend of development is towards automation and flexible network structure. In addition, the stages of telecommunication development are conventionally divided from manual switching to flexible virtualized architecture, to which telecommunications operators have resorted. Furthermore, in the context of the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards framework, the network function virtualization (NFV) with might and main has been evaluated by telecom operators and shows that the efficiency of the topology can be significantly improved. However, it is difficult to organize ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine type communications (mMTC) services within 5G, due to the topology centralization. Moreover, network monitoring, in particular of carrier-class equipment, reveals that there is no ideal static network topology in which the network and its elements have been uniformly loaded over a long service time. Therefore, in this study, a dynamic network topology and service placement is proposed to analyze and predict services, in which Genetic Algorithm (GA) is utilized. In addition, an efficient forecasting and live migration methods of service as an application to edge computing systems are introduced, where this approach can be used in the systems with an intelligent allocation of operator equipment resources for providing flexibility and high-quality topological organization. Finally, simulation results proved that the network equipment efficiency can significantly be increased by more than 30%.",

    "Title": "Lightweight intrusion detection scheme for wireless sensor networks",
    "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are increasingly used in a wide range of potential applications, including security and surveillance, control, actuation and maintenance of complex systems and fine-grain monitoring of indoor and outdoor environments. The nature of wireless sensor networks makes them very vulnerable to attack. The mobile nodes are randomly distributed, there are no physical obstacles for the adversary, therefore, they can be easily captured, and attacks can come from all directions and target any node. Consequently, security of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is the most challenging for this type of network. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) can play an important role in detecting and preventing security attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection system for sensor networks. Our intrusion detection model exploits advantage of support vector machine (SVM) and signature model to detect malicious behaviors and provide a global lightweight IDS in cluster based topology. The proposed model can detect and prevent most of routing attacks.",

    "Title": "Reducing the interprocessors migrations of the EKG algorithm",
    "Abstract": "In this work, we consider the scheduling problem of a set of periodic implicit-deadline and synchronous tasks, on a real-time multiprocessor composed of m identical processors. It is known that the cost of migrations and preemptions has significant influence on global system performances. The EKG algorithm can generate a great number of migrant tasks, but it has the advantage that each migrant task migrates between two processors only. Later, the EDHS algorithm has been proposed in order to minimize the number of migrant tasks of EKG. Although EDHS minimizes the number of migration compared to EKG, its drawback is the generation of additional preemptions caused by the migrations on several processors. In this paper we propose a new tasks allocation algorithm that aims to combine the advantages of EKG (migrations between two processors only) and those of EDHS (reduction of number of migrations).",

    "Abstract": "Social media provide a wide space for people from around the world to communicate, share knowledge and personal experiences. They increasingly become an important data source for opinion mining and sentiment analysis, thanks to shared comments and reviews about products and services. And companies are showing a growing interest to harness their potential, in order to support setting up marketing strategies. Despite the importance of sentiment analysis in decision making, there is a lack of social intelligence integration at the level of customer relationship management systems. Thus, social customer relationship management (SCRM) systems have become an interesting research area. However, they need deep analytic techniques to transform the large amount of data “Big Data” into actionable insights. Such systems also require an advanced modelling and data processing methods, and must consider the emerging paradigm related to proactive systems. In this paper, we propose an agent based social framework that extracts and consolidates the reviews expressed via social media, in order to help enterprises know more about customers’ opinions toward a particular product or service. To illustrate our approach, we present the case study of Twitter reviews that we use to extract opinions and sentiment about a set of products using SentiGem API.

    "Abstract": "Air pollution is considered a major health problem in urban areas. Small sensor technology integrated with smart phones can be widely used to collect air quality information in real time using mobile applications. By applying the concept of crowdsensing, citizens and authorities can be aware of exposure to pollution during their daily activities in urban areas. This paper describes an on-road air quality monitoring and control approach based on the crowdsensing paradigm. In addition to collecting air pollution data, we are exploring the possibility of using this technology to effectively detect critical situations and redistribute all information through a proactive decision support framework. This information can be combined with sensed air quality parameters for displaying, on an interactive map, the detected pollutants’ concentrations using sensors attached to smart phones. The proposed framework provides users with real-time traffic and air quality information, traffic recommendations and notifications, and environmental conditions. Moreover, the authorities can use this system to improve urban mobility and traffic regulation. Such behavior and movements related to geographic information can provide a better understanding of the dynamics of a road network. In this work, we propose to combine the benefits of the crowdsensing paradigm with both machine learning and Big Data tools. An artificial neural networks model and the A* algorithm are used for air quality prediction and the least polluted path finding.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The pervasiveness of mobile devices has led to the permanent use of their new features by the crowd to perform different tasks. The purpose of this paper is to exploit this massive consumption of new information technologies supported by the concept of crowdsourcing in a governmental context to access citizens as a source of ideas and support. The aim is to find out how crowdsourcing combined with the new technologies can constitute a great force to enhance the performance of the suspect investigation process. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a structured view of a suspect investigation framework, especially based on the image processing techniques, including the automatic face analysis. This crowdsourcing framework is mainly based on the personal description as an identification technique to facilitate the suspect investigation and the use of MongoDB as a document-oriented database to store the information. Findings: The case study demonstrates that the proposed framework provides satisfying results in each step of the identification process. The experimental results show how the combination between the crowdsourcing concept and the mobile devices pervasiveness has fruitfully strengthened the identification process with the use of automatic face analysis techniques. Originality/value: A review of the literature has shown that previous work has focused mainly on the presentation of forensic techniques that can be used in the investigation process steps.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to detect opinion leaders, who they play a vital role as influencers of their community, which will help companies to improve their image in social media. This idea came with the fast development of social media, where individuals are increasingly sharing their personal experiences, opinions and critiques about products through these platforms. Thus, the new customers can rely on these spontaneous recommendations to proceed with the purchase without risk of disappointment. Therefore, the mismanagement of the e-reputation can cause huge losses for companies. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a product reputation framework based on the prediction of opinion leaders is presented. To do so, opinion mining has been used to determine the product reputation in social media. In addition to posts processing, the profile information has also exploited to predict opinion leaders. To achieve the authors’ goal, spammers and duplicated profiles have been detected to improve the product reputation results. Findings: The effectiveness of this approach has been tested using a social media simulation. The obtained results show that this approach is efficient and more accurate compared to the classical solutions. Originality/value: The key novelty is the gathering of spammer detection criteria with different weights and the profiles matching by providing the suitable matching methods that take into account the profile’s attributes types. Consequently, a different similarity measure was assigned for each of the considered four attributes types. These two steps can ensure that the results obtained from social media are actually supported by opinions extracted directly from the real physical consumers.",

The deep-learning architecture consists of a Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional Block Attention Module for feature extraction, along with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory for sequence modeling and Connectionist Temporal Classification as a decoder. Data-augmentation techniques are utilized on the images in the database to enhance the system’s ability to recognize a wide range of Arabic characters and to extend the level of abstraction in patterns due to synthetic variations. Our suggested approach has the capability of precisely recognizing Arabic handwritten texts without the necessity of character segmentation, thereby resolving various issues associated with this aspect. The results obtained from the KHATT database highlight the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating a Word Error Rate of 14.55% and a Character Error Rate of 3.25%.",

    "Title": "Subword recognition in historical Arabic manuscripts using handcrafted features and deep learning approaches",
    "Abstract": "Recent years have seen significant endeavors to improve handwriting recognition systems and digitize historical manuscripts. Nevertheless, recognizing historical Arabic manuscripts remains a considerable challenge. The purpose of this study is to investigate subword recognition in historical Arabic manuscripts. Two systems are established. The first system involves using a variety of handcrafted feature methods with diverse machine learning algorithms. The second system uses a deep learning architecture that integrates convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory based on a character model approach with connectionist temporal classification as a decoder. By utilizing the IBN SINA dataset, the histogram of oriented gradients descriptor demonstrated superior performance in the first system, while the second system achieved notable results. The findings of this study provide a framework for the development of historical manuscript recognition systems.",

However, research remains modest compared to that performed in other scripts. This is mainly due to the morphology of Arabic writing, in particular its richness in diacritical marks. This signs are generally recognized by adopting structural or morphological measures. However, the difficulty and variability of handwriting can sometimes be misleading, thus influencing the results obtained. This article presents a new database for Arabic handwritten diacritics (DBAHD). It is designed to serve the Arabic handwriting recognition systems based on segmentation and machine learning.",

    "Abstract": "The neural network is a static classifier that requires fixedsize vector functions. For this reason, it is considered as a very effective approach for recognizing characters and graphemes. More than 80% of the research that implements neural networks uses backpropagation. The retro-propagating neural network can be used in many applications such as character recognition, face recognition, etc. Training of neural networks is a complex task in the field of supervised research. The main difficulty is to find the most appropriate combination of network architecture, learning function, transfer and training for the classification task. In this paper we dress the recognition of Arabic handwriting isolated characters using two types of neural networks: a feed forward and a cascade forward. We achieve different experiments by varying the number of hidden layer neurons, learning functions, and transfer functions. For that, we use our database for Arabic handwritten characters and ligatures (DBAHCL) in the training, test and validation phases. We compare the results based on the mean squared error, accuracy, convergence rate, and classification accuracy.",

    "Abstract": "Frequent item exploration is a fundamental element in many data mining problems aimed at finding interesting models in the data. Recently, the PrePost algorithm, a new algorithm for extraction frequent element sets based on the idea of N-lists, which in most cases surpasses other current state-of-the-art algorithms, has been introduced. The PrePost algorithm's performance deteriorates when it comes to handling big data. Nevertheless, the current existing PrePost algorithms in place implemented with the MapReduce model are not sufficiently powerful for iterative computation. To reduce IO overhead and take advantage of cluster memory, this article offers an enhanced version of PrePost, the Distributed PrePost (DisPrePost), a parallel algorithm built on the Spark framework, which incorporates the concept of resilient distributed datasets and performs in-memory processing to optimize the execution time of operation, that also utilises a HashMap to further refine the N-list creation process. Experience has shown that the DisPrePost algorithm is more efficient and scalable than the two advanced state-of-the-art methods HPrePostPlus and the well-known algorithm HFIM.",

Several existing data mining techniques often through mining frequent itemsets draw association rules and get to relevant knowledge, but with the rapid arrival of the era of big data, traditional data mining algorithms have been impossible to meet large data's analysis needs. Lately, the PrePost algorithm has been suggested, a new algorithm for mining frequent itemsets based on the idea of N-lists.

In this work our attention is addressed toward the study of a highly nonlinear front evolution equation proposed by Csahók et al.

    "Abstract": "We study a simplified multidimensional version of the phenomeno- logical surface growth continuum model derived in [6]. The considered model is a partial differential equation for the surface height profile u which possesses the following free energy functional: E(u) = { 1 2 ln ( 1 + jruj2 ) - jruj arctan (jruj) + 1 2 j(uj2 ) dx; where is the domain of a fixed support on which the growth is carried out. The term jΔuj2 designates the standard surface diffusion in contrast to the second order term which phenomenologically describes the growth instability. The energy above is mainly carried out in regions of higher surface slope (jruj). Hence minimizing such energy corresponds to reducing surface defects during the growth process from a given initial surface configuration. Our analysis is concerned with the energetic and coarsening behaviours of the equilibrium solution. The existence of global energy minimizers and a scaling argument are used to construct a sequence of equilibrium solutions with different wavelength. We apply our minimum energy estimates to derive bounds in terms of the linear system size jj for the characteristic interface width and average slope. We also derive a stable numerical scheme based on the convex-concave decomposition of the energy functional and study its properties while accommodating these results with 1d and 2d numerical simulations.",

Yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and zika are dangerous diseases which still lack a cure, and they are spreading through a specific type of vector, the Ae. aegypti mosquito (called also yellow fever mosquito or stegomyia aegypti). The dynamics of Ae. aegypti are particularly impacted by climatic conditions like high temperature and frequent precipitation and the most affected areas are the ones with tropical climates which are favorable to its growth. However, if current studies and predictions about global climate change are now occurring, many new areas might start facing these diseases threat (see [15, 16, 35, 24, 3]).

    "Title": "Compressive sensing and paillier cryptosystem based secure data collection in WSN",
    "Abstract": "Due to the technological advancements and smart deployment, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) receive much attention in numerous real-time application fields. The stringent limitations of the battery of sensor devices and dubious wireless medium incur enormous challenges in the secure data collection and routing. Integration of compressive sensing and cryptography mechanism provide an efficient paradigm for reliable and energy efficient data collection over WSNs. With the aim of reducing communication cost and resilience against different WSN security attacks, this paper proposes a paillier cryptosystem and compressive sensing based routing (PC2SR) protocol. To achieve its objective, the proposed PC2SR designs three mechanisms that are paillier cryptosystem based key distribution and management, intra-cluster data gathering, and secure data transmission. Initially, the PC2SR provides paillier security keys to each device for data authentication. Instead of providing a long term security keys among two entities, the lightweight key refreshing mechanism of paillier cryptosystem in PC2SR updates the keys over a specific time interval. Secondly, the design of the Spatio-temporal measurement matrix within the intra-cluster reduces the computation and communication costs considerably. The integration of zero noise factors with all transmitted data assists the BS in detecting and isolating malicious behaviors in the network. Thus, the PC2SR efficiently offers high security in terms of integrity and confidentiality over WSN. We compare PC2SR to existing schemes, CSDA developed in 2017 and CSHEAD in early 2021 which outperform CSDA. The new scheme PC2SR offer better performance for all KPIs and thus is the best model combining data confidentiality and attack detection in WSN.",

    "Title": "A novel secure data aggregation scheme based on semihomomorphic encryption in wsns",
    "Abstract": "—Privacy protection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) constitutes a big challenge for the adoption of WSNs in data sensitive applications like health monitoring or tracking and surveillance of borders. Privacy protection require additional controls and communications overloads, which impact the overall network lifetime. Research community has proposed several scenarios to minimize the impact of data protection generally based on secure aggregation and encryption to meet the practical requirements of energy constraints imposed by WSN. However, efficiency of privacy protection must be assessed before deployment. The privacy protection mechanisms are evaluated based on their hackability and network performance using four main metrics: Control Packet Overhead, delay, Throughput, Packet delivery ratio. The purpose of this paper is to propose a secure aggregation scheme based on homomorphic encryption. The new scheme will be will be compared to another scheme based on network metric and attack detection accuracy to have full view on the scheme performance for both network and security metrics. The proposed scheme named “Cluster-based Semi-Homomophic Encryption Aggregated Data” (CSHEAD) offer better performance as it reduces the controls overhead with higher detection accuracy. The conducted simulations confirm the expected results.",

    "Title": "AN ONLINE ENSEMBLE LEARNING MODEL FOR DETECTING ATTACKS IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS",
    "Abstract": "In today’s modern world, the usage of technology is unavoidable, and the rapid advances in the Internet and communication fields have resulted in the expansion of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. However, WSN has been proven to be vulnerable to security breaches. The harsh and unattended deployment of these networks, combined with their constrained resources and the volume of data generated, introduces a major security concern. WSN applications are extremely critical, it is essential to build reliable solutions that involve fast and continuous mechanisms for online stream analysis, allowing the identification of attacks and intrusions. Our aim is to develop an intelligent and efficient intrusion detection system by applying an important machine learning concept known as ensemble learning in order to improve detection performance. Although ensemble models have been proven to be useful in offline learning, they have received less attention in streaming applications. In this paper, we examine the application of different homogeneous and heterogeneous online ensembles in sensory data analysis on a specialized WSN detection system (WSN-DS) dataset in order to classify four types of attacks: Blackhole attack, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling among normal network traffic. Among the proposed novel online ensembles, both the heterogeneous ensemble consisting of an Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) combined with the Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT) algorithm and the homogeneous ensemble HAT made up of 10 models achieved higher detection rates of 96.84 % and 97.2 %, respectively. The above models are efficient and effective in dealing with concept drift while taking into account WSN resource constraints.",

    "Title": "Unified and evolved approach based on neural network and deep learning methods for intrusion detection",
    "Abstract": "Currently, network security has become a major concern for all entities around the world. Attackers employ various methods to disrupt services, which requires new methods to stop them all in one way. Moreover, these intrusions can evolve and overcome security measures and devices, which pushes to use new evolving methods able to accompany the evolution of these threats, to block them. In our paper, we propose a new approach for intrusion detection, founded on neural network (NN) and deep learning (DL) methods. This approach is planned to not only identify threats, but also to develop a long-term memory of them, in order to detect new ones resembling these memorized attacks, and simultaneously, to provide a single way to stop all kinds of intrusions. To test our model, we have chosen the most recently employed methods in literature, NN and DL algorithms: feedforward neural network (FNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), then we have applied them on network security layer-knowledge discovery in databases (NSL KDD) intrusions dataset. The results of experiments were impressive for all the algorithms, with maximum performances noted by LSTM, which affirms the efficacy of our proposed method for intrusion detection.",

    "Title": "Explainable machine learning for predicting recurrence-free survival in endometrial carcinosarcoma patients",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: Endometrial carcinosarcoma is a rare, aggressive high-grade endometrial cancer, accounting for about 5% of all uterine cancers and 15% of deaths from uterine cancers. The treatment can be complex, and the prognosis is poor. Its increasing incidence underscores the urgent requirement for personalized approaches in managing such challenging diseases. Method: In this work, we designed an explainable machine learning approach to predict recurrence-free survival in patients affected by endometrial carcinosarcoma. For this purpose, we exploited the predictive power of clinical and histopathological data, as well as chemotherapy and surgical information collected for a cohort of 80 patients monitored over time. Among these patients, 32.5% have experienced the appearance of a recurrence. Results: The designed model was able to well describe the observed sequence of events, providing a reliable ranking of the survival times based on the individual risk scores, and achieving a C-index equals to 70.00% (95% CI, 59.38–84.74). Conclusion: Accordingly, machine learning methods could support clinicians in discriminating between endometrial carcinosarcoma patients at low-risk or high-risk of recurrence, in a non-invasive and inexpensive way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing a preliminary approach addressing this task.",

    "Title": "High charge of cerebroid nests in nodular melanomas predicts tumor aggressiveness and high mutational tumoral burden: a pilot study",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: Even today, melanoma is a highly aggressive neoplasm with a high mortality rate. The nodular type is very aggressive and has cerebroid nests of melanocytes (CNMs) at the growth edge, morphologically similar to the poorly differentiated neoplastic epithelial cell clusters described in colorectal, breast, and endometrioid endometrial cancers. Patients and methods: We selected 25 nodular melanomas (NMs) with known molecular profiles, of which the entire paraffin-embedded lesion was available. We counted CNMs under a microscopic at a magnification of 20x (i.e., a microscopic field with a major axis of 1 mm). Based on the number of CNMs in the area, melanomas were classified into three groups: G1 (CNMs ranging from 0 to 4), G2 (CNMs ranging from 5 to 9), and G3 (CNMs ≥ 10). The presence of CNMs and their counts were compared with molecular and histopathological data. Results: Seventeen (NMs) were grouped as G1 (68%), 5 as G2 (20%), and 3 as G3 (12%) based on CNMs count. The presence of CNMs correlated with epithelioid cell morphology (p < 0.05), Clark IV and V levels (p < 0.05), vascular invasion (p < 0.05), and biological mutants (p < 0.05). Melanomas with ≥ 10 CNMs more frequently show ulceration (p < 0.02) and the BRAF V600E mutation (p < 0.02). Conclusion: CNMs count has a predictive role regardless of tumor size; their association with the BRAF V600E mutation suggests their predictive significance in response to biologics. However, further investigations are needed to strengthen this hypothesis.",

    "Title": "Value of autopsy in the modern age: Discrepancy between clinical and autopsy diagnoses",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Autopsy is a medical procedure that consists of the examination of the corpse to determine the cause of death and obtain information on pathological conditions or injuries. In recent years, there has been a reduction in hospital autopsies and an increase in forensic autopsies. AIM To evaluate the utility of autopsy in the modern age and the discrepancy between clinical and autopsy diagnoses. METHODS A retrospective observational study was conducted on the reports of all 645 hospital autopsies performed at Polyclinic of Bari from 2006 to 2021. RESULTS Group A, 2006-2009, 174 cases were studied: 58% male, 58% adults, 55% neonatology; pulmonary disease was the cause of death in 23% of cases; and there was a discrepancy between clinical and autopsy diagnosis in 55% of cases. Group B, 2010-2013, 119 cases: 52% male, 46% infants, 48% neonatology; pulmonary disease was the cause of death in 25% of cases; and there was a discrepancy between clinical and autopsy diagnosis in 56% of cases. Group C, 2014-2017, 168 cases: sex equality, 37% infants, 25% gynecology; pulmonary disease was the cause of death in 24% of cases; and there was a discrepancy between clinical and autopsy diagnosis in 58% of cases. Group D, 2018-2021, 184 cases: 56% male, 38% adult, 32% gynecology; pulmonary disease was the cause of death in 27% of cases; and there was a discrepancy between clinical and autopsy diagnosis in 58% of cases. CONCLUSION The study of hospital autopsies reveals a 56.75% discrepancy between clinical diagnosis and autopsy, highlighting the importance of autopsies, especially for fetal and neonatal diseases, which represent 59% of cases.",

    "Title": "Keratosis Pilaris-like Eruption during Treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: Literature Review and Report of a Case Related to Imatinib",
    "Abstract": "The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) blocking BCR-ABL activity has revolutionized the therapeutic management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Adverse cutaneous reactions (ACRs) are common nonhematologic adverse events associated with the use of BCR-ABL TKIs. A characteristic pattern of eruption resembling keratosis pilaris (KP) has been described in patients treated with these drugs, especially nilotinib and dasatinib. The pathogenesis of this ACR is still unknown. This type of reaction appears to be uncommon with imatinib. Here, we report the case of an elderly patient with an asymptomatic KP-like eruption, which appeared one month after starting treatment with imatinib for CML. The case presentation is accompanied by a review of similar reactions in patients with CML treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors, attempting to make an excursus on the molecular targets of such drugs and possible mechanisms underlying this ACR.",

    "Title": "An artificial intelligence-based model exploiting H&amp;E images to predict recurrence in negative sentinel lymph-node melanoma patients",
    "Abstract": "Background: Risk stratification and treatment benefit prediction models are urgent to improve negative sentinel lymph node (SLN-) melanoma patient selection, thus avoiding costly and toxic treatments in patients at low risk of recurrence. To this end, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) could help clinicians to better calculate the recurrence risk and choose whether to perform adjuvant therapy. Methods: We made use of AI to predict recurrence-free status (RFS) within 2-years from diagnosis in 94 SLN- melanoma patients. In detail, we detected quantitative imaging information from H&E slides of a cohort of 71 SLN- melanoma patients, who registered at Istituto Tumori “Giovanni Paolo II” in Bari, Italy (investigational cohort, IC). For each slide, two expert pathologists firstly annotated two Regions of Interest (ROIs) containing tumor cells alone (TUMOR ROI) or with infiltrating cells (TUMOR + INF ROI). In correspondence of the two kinds of ROIs, two AI-based models were developed to extract information directly from the tiles in which each ROI was automatically divided. This information was then used to predict RFS. Performances of the models were computed according to a 5-fold cross validation scheme. We further validated the prediction power of the two models on an independent external validation cohort of 23 SLN- melanoma patients (validation cohort, VC). Results: The TUMOR ROIs have revealed more informative than the TUMOR + INF ROIs. An Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 79.1% and 62.3%, a sensitivity value of 81.2% and 76.9%, a specificity value of 70.0% and 43.3%, an accuracy value of 73.2% and 53.4%, were achieved on the TUMOR and TUMOR + INF ROIs extracted for the IC cohort, respectively. An AUC value of 76.5% and 65.2%, a sensitivity value of 66.7% and 41.6%, a specificity value of 70.0% and 55.9%, an accuracy value of 70.0% and 56.5%, were achieved on the TUMOR and TUMOR + INF ROIs extracted for the VC cohort, respectively. Conclusions: Our approach represents a first effort to develop a non-invasive prognostic method to better define the recurrence risk and improve the management of SLN- melanoma patients.",

    "Abstract": "Tattoo-associated cutaneous reactions have become quite frequent given the increasing percentage of tattooed subjects globally and also in Italy. On the other hand, the increasing use of target therapy is showing the ability of these drugs to affect the immune system and also cause adverse tattoo-related reactions. In this paper, we report a case of a 42-year-old patient with stage-IIID melanoma undergoing treatment with Dabrafenib and Trametinib. The patient reported erythema, oedema and scaling in areas of the body containing a black tattoo, and, conversely, no signs and/or symptoms in areas with tattoos of a different color. Histopathological and immunohistochemical features indicated a lympho-histiocytic reaction with a granulomatous morphology, mainly distributed around the vessels and hair adnexa. By discussing the cases reported in the literature prior to ours, we concluded and provided the possible indications of the pathogenesis.",

    "Title": "An explainable machine learning model to solid adnexal masses diagnosis based on clinical data and qualitative ultrasound indicators",
    "Abstract": "Background: Accurate characterization of newly diagnosed a solid adnexal lesion is a key step in defining the most appropriate therapeutic approach. Despite guidance from the International Ovarian Tumor Analyzes Panel, the evaluation of these lesions can be challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated how machine learning techniques can be applied to clinical data to solve this diagnostic problem. However, ML models can often consider as black-boxes due to the difficulty of understanding the decision-making process used by the algorithm to obtain a specific result. Aims: For this purpose, we propose an Explainable Artificial Intelligence model trained on clinical characteristics and qualitative ultrasound indicators to predict solid adnexal masses diagnosis. Materials & Methods: Since the diagnostic task was a three-class problem (benign tumor, invasive cancer, or ovarian metastasis), we proposed a waterfall classification model: a first model was trained and validated to discriminate benign versus malignant, a second model was trained to distinguish nonmetastatic versus metastatic malignant lesion which occurs when a patient is predicted to be malignant by the first model. Firstly, a stepwise feature selection procedure was implemented. The classification performances were validated on Leave One Out scheme. Results: The accuracy of the three-class model reaches an overall accuracy of 86.36%, and the precision per-class of the benign, nonmetastatic malignant, and metastatic malignant classes were 86.96%, 87.27%, and 77.78%, respectively. Discussion: SHapley Additive exPlanations were performed to visually show how the machine learning model made a specific decision. For each patient, the SHAP values expressed how each characteristic contributed to the classification result. Such information represents an added value for the clinical usability of a diagnostic system. Conclusions: This is the first work that attempts to design an explainable machine-learning tool for the histological diagnosis of solid masses of the ovary.",

    "Title": "Evaluation of modulation of immunity by lymph node transfer: A preliminary histological evidence in lymphedema patients",
    "Abstract": "Background: The exact knowledge of the local biological and immunological effects of vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) continues to be an emerging science but a positive control positive control over infectious and immune-mediated processes is often advocated. Knowing the characterization of the inflammatory infiltrate associated with lymphedema, the aim of this paper is to verify the hypothesis that VLNT is able to modulate the inflammatory and immune microenvironment of lymphedematous tissue by evaluating any modification of the local inflammatory cell infiltrate. Patients and Methods: A prospectively database of patients who received VLN transfer for lower extremity lymphedema between January 2018 and December 2020 was reviewed. Nine patients diagnosed with extremities' stage II secondary lymphedema were included, with a mean age of 55.3 (range 39–66 years) years. Gastroepiploic lymph node transfer was performed in all patients and transferred heterotopically. Full thickness 6-mm skin punch biopsies were obtained from all voluntary lymph node transfer patients at identical sites of the lymphedematous limb during the surgical procedure of VLNT (T0) and 1 year later (T1). Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against the following markers: anti-CD3; anti-CD4; anti-CD8; anti-CD68. Data at T0 were compared to those at T1. Results: Post-operative course was uneventful in all cases experiencing a significant reduction (almost a third) in terms of cellulitis episodes: The median duration of follow-up for patients was 28.3 months (range 12–40). The analysis of the density of the inflammatory cells as a whole revealed a significant reduction at T1 compared to T0. Specifically, CD3 expression levels turned from 16.36 ± 3.421 (cells/mm2) pre-operatively to 7.6 ± 1.511 (cells/mm2) post-operatively (p <.0001). CD4+ cells turned from 7.270 ± 3.421 (cells/mm2) at T0 to 4.815 ± 1.511 cells/mm2 at T1 (p =.0173). CD8 expression values decreased from 4.360 ± 3.421 (cells/mm2) to 2.753 ± 1.451 (cell/mm2) at T1 (p =.0003). Monocyte/macrophage marker CD68 varied from 8.208 ± 2.314 (cells/mm2) at T0 to 7.600 ± 1876 (cells/mm2) at T1 (p =.0003). Conclusion: VLNT decreases skin and subcutaneous tissues' infiltration of inflammatory cells, providing one explanation for the positive control of lymph node transfer procedure over infectious and immune-mediated processes.",

    "Title": "PRAME Is an Effective Tool for the Diagnosis of Nevus-Associated Cutaneous Melanoma",
    "Abstract": "(1) Background: Nevus-associated cutaneous melanoma (CM) is relatively common in the clinical practice of dermatopathologists. The correct diagnosis and staging of nevus-associated cutaneous melanoma (CM) mainly relies on the correct discrimination between benign and malignant cells. Recently, PRAME has emerged as a promising immunohistochemical marker of malignant melanocytes. (2) Methods: PRAME immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in 69 cases of nevus-associated CMs. Its expression was evaluated using a score ranging from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of melanocytic cells with a nuclear expression. PRAME IHC sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were assessed. Furthermore, the agreement between morphological data and PRAME expression was evaluated for the diagnosis of melanoma components and nevus components. (3) Results: PRAME IHC showed a sensitivity of 59%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 71%. The diagnostic agreement between morphology and PRAME IHC was fair (Cohen’s Kappa: 0.3); the diagnostic agreement regarding the benign nevus components associated with CM was perfect (Cohen’s Kappa: 1.0). PRAME was significantly more expressed in thick invasive CMs than in thin cases (p = 0.02). (4) Conclusions: PRAME IHC should be considered for the diagnostic evaluation of nevus-associated CM and is most useful in cases of thick melanomas. Pathologists should carefully consider that a PRAME-positive cellular population within the context of a nevus could indicate a CM associated with the nevus. A negative result does not rule out this possibility.",

    "Title": "Pre-Pectoral Tissue Expander and Acellular Dermal Matrix for a Two-Stage Muscle Sparing Breast Reconstruction: Indications, Surgical Technique and Clinical Outcomes with Histological and Ultrasound Follow-Up—A Population-Based Cohort Study",
    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of the paper is to present a single-center experience with two-stage pre-pectoral breast reconstruction using tissue expander entirely covered by acellular dermal matrix (ADM), reporting surgical indications, technique, clinical and histological outcomes. Materials and Methods: A prospectively maintained database of consecutive patients who had undergone immediate pre-pectoral expander-based breast reconstruction with ADM over a two years period (2019–2021) was analyzed. The primary clinical outcome measures included patients' subjective assessment of satisfaction and pain. Secondary outcomes were complication rates, the frequency of readmissions and incidence of capsular contracture. All patients underwent ultrasound examination 3 weeks postoperatively and at the end of tissue expansion completion. Histological examination of the periprosthetic tissue was performed during the second stage of the reconstructive procedure. Results: A total of 46 patients with a mean age of 46.5 years (range: 24–62) underwent collectively 54 breast reconstructions with a mean follow-up of 22.5 months after definitive implant placement. The time to reach the final volume was on average 47.2 days (range 40–58). Complications occurred in 14 (25.9%) breast reconstructions: 11 (20.4%) seromas, 2 (3.7%) infections, 1 (1.8%) flap necroses, 2(3.7%) expander removals. Overall scores for Satisfaction were all significantly increased after surgery. Histological examination revealed complete ADM integration in the host tissue, with thinner, less sclerotic tissue compared to the submuscular capsular samples. Conclusions: Tissue expander-ADM-based breast reconstruction can be safely used in selected cases for two-stage pre-pectoral breast reconstructions and can result in significant pain-relief procedure with optimal aesthetical outcomes.

    "Title": "Mast cell density in Merkel cell carcinoma and its correlation with prognostic features and MCPyV status: a pilot study",
    "Abstract": "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, highly aggressive, primitive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, the origin of which is not yet fully understood. Numerous independent prognostic factors have been investigated in an attempt to understand which are the most important parameters to indicate in the histological diagnostic report of MCC. Of these, mast cells have only been studied in one paper before this one. We present a retrospective descriptive study of 13 cases of MCC, received at the Department of Pathology over a 20-year period (2003–2023 inclusive) on which we performed a study using whole-slide (WSI) morphometric analysis scanning platform Aperio Scanscope CS for the detection and spatial distribution of mast cells, using monoclonal anti-tryptase antibody and anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody to study the density of microvessels. In addition, we analyzed MCPyV status with the antibody for MCPyV large T-antigen (Clone CM2B4). We found statistically significant correlation between mast cell density and local recurrence/distant metastasis/death-of-disease (p = 0.008). To our knowledge, we firstly reported that MCPyV (−) MCC shows higher mast cells density compared to MCPyV (+) MCC, the latter well known to be less aggressive. Besides, the median vascular density did not show no significant correlation with recurrence/metastasis/death-of-disease, (p = 0.18). Despite the small sample size, this paper prompts future studies investigating the role of mast cell density in MCC.",

    "Title": "Artificial intelligence in dermatopathology: Updates, strengths, and challenges",
    "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved to become a significant force in various domains, including medicine. We explore the role of AI in pathology, with a specific focus on dermatopathology and neoplastic dermatopathology. AI, encompassing machine learning and deep learning, has demonstrated its potential in tasks ranging from diagnostic applications on whole slide imaging to predictive and prognostic functions in skin pathology. In dermatopathology, studies have assessed AI's ability to identify skin lesions, classify melanomas, and improve diagnostic accuracy. Results indicate that AI, particularly convolutional neural networks, can outperform human pathologists in terms of sensitivity and specificity. AI aids in predicting disease outcomes, identifying aggressive tumors, and differentiating between various skin conditions. Neoplastic dermatopathology showcases AI's prowess in classifying melanocytic lesions, discriminating between melanomas and nevi, and aids dermatopathologists in making accurate diagnoses. Studies emphasize the reproducibility and diagnostic aid that AI provides, especially in challenging cases. In inflammatory and lymphoproliferative dermatopathology, limited research exists, but studies show attempts to use AI to differentiate conditions such as mycosis fungoides and eczema. Although some results are promising, further exploration is needed in these areas. We highlight the extraordinary interest AI has garnered in the scientific community and its potential to assist clinicians and pathologists. Despite the advancements, we have stressed the importance of collaboration between medical professionals, computer scientists, bioinformaticians, and engineers to harness AI's benefits and acknowledging its limitations and risks. The integration of AI into dermatopathology holds great promise, positioning it as a valuable tool rather than as a replacement for human expertise.",

    "Title": "Conventional Versus Regenerative Methods for Wound Healing: A Comparative Experimental Study on a Sheep Model",
    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Wound healing is a complex process involving cellular, anatomical, and functional repair, often hindered in chronic wounds associated with diseases like diabetes and vascular disorders. This study investigated the efficacy of conventional and regenerative wound healing approaches in a sheep surgical wound model. Materials and Methods: Six female Bergamasca sheep underwent five full-thickness skin lesions treated with various methods: sterile gauze (control), chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite, micronized dermis system application, and dermal matrix. Wound healing progression was monitored over 42 days through wound dimension measurements, exudate analysis, and histopathological evaluations. Results: The results indicated that all wounds healed completely by day 42, with significant reductions in wound size and exudate over time. Notably, Micronized dermis system application and dermal matrix treatments showed a faster evolution in exudate characteristics and improved collagen reorganization compared to other treatments. Histological analysis revealed earlier neovascularization and better reconstitution of hair follicles in these groups. Despite the lack of significant differences in healing time, both regenerative approaches enhanced wound healing phases, contributing to exudate control, angiogenesis promotion, and reduced scar formation. Conclusions: The findings suggest that while micronized dermis system application and dermal matrix do not accelerate acute wound healing compared to conventional methods, they offer potential benefits in managing exudate and improving tissue regeneration, warranting further investigation in chronic wound scenarios.",

    "Title": "“The Strange Case of Dr Pump and Mr Acardiac”: The Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion (TRAP) Sequence in Two Monochorionic Monoamniotic (MCMA) Twin Pregnancies—Diagnosis, Prognosis and Management: Review of Literature",
    "Abstract": "The Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion (TRAP) Sequence is an extremely rare complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies, with one severely malformed twin (the “acardiac”) lacking autonomous placental blood supply and being perfused by the co-twin (the “pump”), through arterio-arterial (and sometimes also veno-venous) vascular anastomoses located on the placental surface. The prognosis is poor: mortality is 100% in the acardiac twin because of its severe malformations and about 50–55% in the pump twin, mainly due to heart failure and prematurity. So, the goal of perinatal management of the TRAP twin pregnancy is to deliver a healthy and near-term pump twin without heart failure or fetal hydrops. Intuitively, the earlier the diagnosis, the better the outcome. Herein, we report two cases of monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) twin pregnancies complicated by the TRAP Sequence, which are of interest since the objective of early diagnosis was achieved by means of transvaginal and 3D ultrasound, two techniques which revealed themselves as being useful to this purpose but are underused in the literature. The second aim of this study is to provide an overview of literature data about the diagnosis, prognosis establishment, and management of this rare condition, which are still debated and unclear due to negligible poor-quality evidence.",

    "Title": "Primary Epithelioid Angiosarcoma of the Penis: A Case Report with a Brief Review of the Literature",
    "Abstract": "Angiosarcoma of the penis is an exceptionally rare mesenchymal tumor, with only about 30 cases documented in the literature. Because of its rarity and the often nonspecific clinical presentation, histopathological examination plays a critical role in accurate diagnosis. Angiosarcoma of the penis typically arises in the corpus cavernosum but has also been reported in the glans and urethra, often presenting with metastases. This report details a case of epithelioid angiosarcoma of the penis in an 84-year-old man, who presented with a rapidly enlarging, violaceous nodule on the glans penis. Histopathology revealed atypical epithelioid endothelial cells with pleomorphism and mitotic activity, and immunohistochemical markers such as CD31, Erythroblast transformation-specific [ETS]-related gene, and cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene confirmed the malignant endothelial neoplasm. The differential diagnosis excluded conditions such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and Kaposi sarcoma. Because of the rarity, standardized treatment protocols are lacking; however, wide excision with tumor-free margins and the potential for targeted therapies based on gene amplification are considered important. The review highlights the diagnostic challenges, prognostic factors, and current therapeutic approaches, emphasizing the need for further research to develop standardized treatment protocols.",

    "Title": "Cutaneous Perivascular Hemophagocytosis: A Report of 2 Cases With Emphasis on Clinical and Histological Features",
    "Abstract": "Cutaneous perivascular hemophagocytosis (CH) is a histological manifestation that manifests as systemic hemophagocytic syndrome, also known as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, when accompanied by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction, and cytopenia, and may rarely manifest independently of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. CH typically presents as purpuric or brownish macules and patches on the extremities, abdomen, and trunks. Histopathologically, the hallmark of CH includes extravasated erythrocytes and karyorrhectic debris phagocytized by histiocytes, associated with dermal capillary ectasia, perivascular infiltration of neutrophils, nuclear dust, and histiocytes without atypia. In this study, we report 2 cases of CH encountered in routine diagnostic practice and elucidate their significant clinical and histologic features. Our first patient had leukocytoclastic vasculitis with CH in the setting of Yersinia enterocolitis, and the second case represents CH in association with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study highlights the importance of considering CH as a potential indicator of underlying systemic pathology, including infectious and hematological disorders, in clinical practice.",

    "Title": "Hidradenocarcinoma of the Chest With Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis: Report of 2 Cases and Systematic Literature Review of a Breast Cancer Mimicker",
    "Abstract": "Hidradenocarcinoma (HAC) is a rare malignant neoplasm originating from eccrine sweat glands, often presenting diagnostic challenges because of its resemblance to other malignancies, particularly breast cancer when occurring in the chest region. This report describes 2 cases of HAC with axillary lymph node metastasis, both initially misinterpreted clinically. The first case involved a 63-year-old woman with a sternal mass, near the right breast, initially suspected to be a sebaceous cyst. Histologic examination revealed a solid-cystic epithelial tumor with features suggestive of HAC, confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. The second case concerned an 81-year-old woman with a subcutaneous growth in the sternal area, also diagnosed as HAC after histopathologic and immunohistochemical assessment. Both cases demonstrated strong estrogen receptor positivity, leading to the recommendation of hormonal therapy. A systematic review of the literature identified 21 similar cases of HAC in the chest wall, highlighting the diagnostic complexities and the potential for these tumors to mimic breast carcinoma. This review underscores the need for careful histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation to differentiate HAC from other malignancies, particularly in the breast region. Given the rare and the potential aggressive nature of HAC, early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for guiding appropriate therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes.",

    "Title": "BRCA Mutation Patients: Are There Other Predisposing Factors for Ovarian Cancer Occurrence? A Multicenter Retrospective Study",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: The objective of this multicenter retrospective study aimed to evaluate the association of clinical variables and the incidence of ovarian cancer in patientswith BRCA 1-2 mutation carriers who underwent risk-reducing salpingooophorectomy (RRSO). Design: Patients with a pathogenic mutation of BRCA 1-2 genes and with no evidence of disease are considered eligible. The exclusion criterion was the refusal to undergo the surgery. The retrospective study included all RRSO performed from May 2015 to April 2022 in the three gynecological Institutions of Southern Italy for were included in this retrospective study. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: Age, menarche age, BMI, menopause at time of RRSO, breast cancer first- and second-degree relatives, ovarian cancer first- and second-degree relatives, estroprogestin use, pregnancy normal full-term delivery, history of endometriosis, previous breast cancer and histologic type, previous abdominal/pelvic surgery, BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 status, preoperative serum CA-125 levels (IU/mL), age at time of RRSO and histological analysis were collected. Results: 184 were recruited. One was excluded. To assess cancer risk, the outcome variable was classified into three classes: no event, cancer, and other conditions excluding cancer. 14 women presented ovarian cancer and tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) on histopathologic final report. Ovarian cancer was found in 8 patients, whereas the presence of STIC was found in 6 of them. Limitations: The low incidence of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer or STIC compared with the total number of patients undergoing RRSO is a potential bias. Conclusions: Our study did not demonstrate a correlation between clinical features and the occurrence of precancerous or cancerous lesions in BRCA mutation carrier patients.",

    "Title": "Lymph Node Transfer and Neolymphangiogenesis: From Theory to Evidence",
    "Abstract": "Background: Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) has proven to be a valuable treatment for patients with advanced stages of lymphedema. Although spontaneous neolymphangiogenesis has been advocated to explain the positive effects of VLNT, there is still a lack of supportive biological evidence. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the postoperative formation of new lymphatic vessels using histologic skin sections from the lymphedematous limb. Methods: Patients with lymphedema of the extremities who had undergone gastroepiploic vascularized lymph node flap surgery between January of 2016 and December of 2018 were identified. Full-thickness 6-mm skin-punch biopsy specimens were obtained from patients at identical sites of the lymphedematous limb during the VLNT surgical procedure (T0) and 1 year later (T1). The histologic samples were immunostained with anti-podoplanin/gp36 antibody. Results: A total of 14 patients with lymph node transfer were included. At the 12-month follow-up, the mean circumference reduction rate was 44.3 ± 4.4 at the above-elbow/above-knee level and 60.9 ± 7 at the below-elbow/below-knee level. Podoplanin expression values were, on average, 7.92 ± 1.77 vessels/mm2 at T0 and 11.79 ± 3.38 vessels/mm2 at T1. The difference between preoperative and postoperative values was statistically significant (P = 0.0008). Conclusion: This study provides anatomic evidence that a neolymphangiogenic process is induced by the VLNT procedure because new functional lymphatic vessels can be detected in close proximity to the transferred lymph nodes.

    "Title": "A human-interpretable machine learning pipeline based on ultrasound to support leiomyosarcoma diagnosis",
    "Abstract": "The preoperative evaluation of myometrial tumors is essential to avoid delayed treatment and to establish the appropriate surgical approach. Specifically, the differential diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is particularly challenging due to the overlapping of clinical, laboratory and ultrasound features between fibroids and LMS. In this work, we present a human-interpretable machine learning (ML) pipeline to support the preoperative differential diagnosis of LMS from leiomyomas, based on both clinical data and gynecological ultrasound assessment of 68 patients (8 with LMS diagnosis). The pipeline provides the following novel contributions: (i) end-users have been involved both in the definition of the ML tasks and in the evaluation of the overall approach; (ii) clinical specialists get a full understanding of both the decision-making mechanisms of the ML algorithms and the impact of the features on each automatic decision. Moreover, the proposed pipeline addresses some of the problems concerning both the imbalance of the two classes by analyzing and selecting the best combination of the synthetic oversampling strategy of the minority class and the classification algorithm among different choices, and the explainability of the features at global and local levels. The results show very high performance of the best strategy (AUC = 0.99, F1 = 0.87) and the strong and stable impact of two ultrasound-based features (i.e., tumor borders and consistency of the lesions). Furthermore, the SHAP algorithm was exploited to quantify the impact of the features at the local level and a specific module was developed to provide a template-based natural language (NL) translation of the explanations for enhancing their interpretability and fostering the use of ML in the clinical setting.",

    "Abstract": "Over the past decade, advancements in molecular biology have contributed to changes in the diagnostic classification of Spitz neoplasms, including Spitz nevi, atypical Spitz tumors, and Spitz melanomas. The recent World Health Organization classification of skin tumors identifies fusion kinases, including NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3, as critical drivers of these lesions. New fusion genes have continued to expand the spectrum of known molecular alterations, particularly within the category of Spitz NTRK-rearranged lesions. We present 2 new cases of NTRK-rearranged Spitz lesions: an atypical Spitz tumor with common LMNA::NTRK1 fusion and an atypical Spitz tumor with a rare PRDX1::NTRK1 fusion. Clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses were performed to diagnose these patients. This report adds to the growing body of knowledge on NTRK-rearranged Spitz lesions and underscores the importance of integrating molecular findings with morphological and immunohistochemical data for the accurate classification and understanding of these neoplasms.",

    "Title": "Efficacy of Systematic Early-Second-Trimester Ultrasound Screening for Facial Anomalies: A Comparison between Prenatal Ultrasound and Postmortem Findings",
    "Abstract": "Second-trimester 2D ultrasound (US) assessment of the fetal anatomy, as proposed by worldwide guidelines, allows detecting the majority of fetal malformation. However, the detection rates of fetal facial anomalies seem to still be low, mostly in cases of isolated facial malformation. The purpose of this research was to assess and analyze the concordance between the antenatal imaging findings from second-trimester US screening and the results of fetal postmortem autopsy. Between January 2010 and January 2020, there were 43 cases where fetuses with prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of a face abnormality, associated or not with a genetic syndrome or chromosomal disorder, following intrauterine death (IUD) or termination of pregnancy (TOP) after the 13 weeks of pregnancy, underwent autopsy in the Pathological Anatomy section of Bari Polyclinic specializing in feto-placental autopsies. The diagnosis of the fetal facial defects at ultrasound was compared with the findings at autopsy in all cases. A very high level of agreement between prenatal ultrasound and autopsy findings was found for facial abnormalities associated with genetic syndromes or numerical abnormality of chromosomes. A lower level of concordance was instead found in isolated facial defects or those associated with other organ anomalies, but not associated with genetic syndrome or numerical chromosome anomaly. A detailed examination of aborted fetuses led to successful quality control of early-second-trimester ultrasound detection of facial anomalies; however, it was less accurate for the isolated ones. It is, thus, reasonable to propose a systematic early-second-trimester prenatal ultrasound screening for facial anatomy by operators specialized in fetal medicine field, using 2D, 3D, and 4D techniques (two-, three-, and four-dimensional ultrasound).",

    "Title": "Inadvertent Administration of 72 µg of Follitropin-Δ for Three Consecutive Days Does Not Appear to Be Dangerous for Poor Responders: A Case Series",
    "Abstract": "Follitropin delta (Δ) is a recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH), like natural human FSH, that can stimulate the development and growth of multiple follicles. Treatment with Follitropin-Δ may cause mild to severe adverse reactions, such as the risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, resulting in nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, weight loss, respiratory difficulty, stomach swelling and discomfort of the pelvic area, headaches, and fatigue. To date, the effects of a Follitropin-Δ overdosage are unknown, and no data are reported in the scientific literature or in the drug data sheet. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the effects of Follitropin-Δ overdosages in poorly responding women who underwent IVF cycles. This is a descriptive case series of four nulligravid, poorly responding patients, two of whom made requests for fertility preservation. Four poorly responding patients who were prescribed 20.0 µg/day of Follitropin-Δ for three consecutive days wrongly injected the total cartridge of 72 µg Follitropin-Δ every day. After the incorrect injection of Follitropin-Δ, the patients continued their controlled ovarian stimulation and underwent vaginal ovarian pick up. The analyzed patients had no side effects or adverse reactions. The evaluations reported in this case series showed that the accidental use of 72 µg/day of Follitropin-Δ for three days did not cause side effects or adverse reactions in poor responders.",

    "Abstract": "Cutis verticis gyrata (CVG) is a rare disorder of the scalp that entails the development of ridges and furrows, which mimic the anatomical conformation of the brain. This skin condition has been classified in primary essential, primary non-essential, and secondary CVG, depending on the presence or absence of other associated disorders. We present the case report of a one-month-old female newborn affected by congenital CVG (CCVG), who also received a diagnosis of Turner syndrome (TS). Skin folding was present at birth and located at the left frontal region of the scalp in the sagittal plane. Our purpose was to make this pathology clinically and tricoscopically better known, since it can be related to different genetic, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions, etc. Non-invasive investigations, such as ultrasonography (U/S) of the brain and scalp and trichoscopy, were also used to obtain the important clues necessary to help in the CVG classification. The clinical diagnosis and trichoscopical investigation of CVG may also be useful for those patients who may have a genetic disease that is not screened for during prenatal examinations.",

We report the case of a 77-year-old man who presented with a 4-week history of non-pruritic generalised macules, papules, nodules and plaques. Histopathologically, there was a dense perivascular and periadnexal lympho-histiocytic dermal infiltrate with non-palisading and non-caseifying epithelioid granulomas and abundant plasma cells. The diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed by serology and immunohistochemical detection of Treponema pallidum in the biopsy specimen.

    "Title": "Placental Angiodysplasia: A New Sign for Prediction of Fetal Outcome?",
    "Abstract": "The study of the placenta is of great importance, not only in the attempt to understand the etiopathogenesis of various maternal-fetal pathologies, but also in the attempt to understand whether it is possible to find the cause of pathological neonatal outcomes. On the other hand, abnormalities of blood vessel formation, such as angiodysplasias, have been poorly characterised in the literature, and there is a need for more studies investigating the potential impact on the fetus. In this paper, we retrospectively analysed 2063 placentas received at the Department of Pathology of the University of Bari ‘Aldo Moro’, among which we identified 70 placentas affected by angiodysplasia. On these placentas, we carried out histochemical staining with Masson’s Trichrome, orcein-alcian blue, and, subsequently, immunostaining with anti-CD31, CD34, and desmin and actin muscle smoothness antibodies. Finally, we performed a morphometric analysis on the allantochorionic and truncal vessels and correlated the results with neonatal outcomes. We studied the characteristics of the angiodysplasias in detail, dividing the patients into two classes (A and B) according to the morphology and histochemical characteristics of the affected vessels; statistical analysis reported a statistically significant association (p < 0.05) between the ratio of maximum thickness to maximum diameter (Tmax/Dmax) and neonatal outcome, with only 30% physiological outcome in the cohort of the placentas affected by angiodysplasia. These results shed light on a rather neglected aspect in the 2015 Amsterdam Classification, as well as in the literature, and provided strong evidence that placental angiodysplasia is predictive of an increased likelihood of the pathological fetal outcome, while other factors remain in the field. Studies with larger case series and guidelines with more attention to these aspects are mandated to further investigate the predictive potential of this pathology.",

    "Title": "Requests for Compensation in Cases Involving Patients’ Falls in Healthcare Settings: A Retrospective Analysis",
    "Abstract": "Falls are the most frequent adverse events recorded in healthcare facilities. By employing a multifaceted strategy to ensure prevention interventions that are specific to the patient type and environmental risk management, risk factor evaluation may help to reduce falls in the hospital setting. Patient falls are one of the main causes of lawsuits against hospitals, which has led to the development of validated instruments that are beneficial in treating the patient after the incident and effective in minimizing the frequency of falls. The aim of our study is to evaluate compensation claims asserting healthcare culpability in situations where a patient fell in a hospital setting. The collected data relate to judgments issued in Italy until December 2022 regarding 30 episodes of falls that occurred between 2003 and 2018. Our research revealed that approximately 50% of Italian healthcare organizations lose the case in court when a patient falls in a hospital setting and dies or is injured. In half of these cases, the failure of the medical staff to use protective equipment against falls is what led to the court’s acceptance of the compensation claim. In order to improve the quality of healthcare services, fall prevention techniques must continue to be implemented.",

    "Title": "Immune disturbance leads to pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 more than classical risk factors: a clinical and histological study",
    "Abstract": "COVID-19 induces endotheliitis and one of the main complications is enhanced coagulation. The incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 (CPE) has increased and clinical features for a rigorous analysis still need to be determined. Thus, we evaluated the clinical characteristics in CPE and the immune infiltration that occurred. Between January 1 and December 31, 2021, 38 patients were affected by CPE (9 ICU, 19 males/19 females, 70.18 ± 11.24 years) out of 459 COVID-19 cases. Controls were subjects who were evaluated for PE between January 1 2015, and December 31, 2019 (92 patients, 9 ICU, 48 males/45 females, 69.55 ± 16.59 years). All patients underwent complete physical examination, pulmonary computed tomography, laboratory tests, D-dimer, and blood gas analysis. There were no differences in laboratory tests or D-dimer. In patients with CPE, pO2, alveolar–arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2), oxygen saturation %, and the ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), P/F, were significantly increased. There were no differences in PaCO2. Platelet count was inversely correlated to P/F (r = − 0.389, p = 0.02) but directly to A-aDO2 (r = 0.699, p = 0.001) only in patients with CPE. Histology of lung biopsies (7 CPE/7 controls) of patients with CPE showed an increase in CD15+ cells, HMGB1, and extracellular MPO as a marker of NETosis, while no significant differences were found in CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and intracellular MPO. Overall, data suggest that CPE has a different clinical setting. Reduced oxygen content and saturation described in Patients with CPE should not be considered a trustworthy sign of disease. Increased A-aDO2 may indicate that CPE involves the smallest vessels as compared to classical PE. The significant difference in NETosis may suggest the mechanism related to thrombi formation.",

The therapeutic target in immunocompetent subjects can be reached using different methods, including topical ointments, cryotherapy, laser therapy, imiquimod, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). We present a case of a male HIV-positive patient who came to the Dermatology department with multifocal wart lesions on his face, auricular, and retro-auricular areas after treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our case, surprisingly, only one session of PDT proved to induce complete regression of lesions which, despite their thickness, had a much more robust response to treatment than we could have possibly expected. After a brief review of the literature, it is possible to state that PDT revealed itself to be a valid option in immunocompromised patients who have a major risk of relapse.",

    "Title": "Photography as the Sole Means of Proof: Medical Liability in Dermatology",
    "Abstract": "Malignant melanoma is a cutaneous malignancy resulting from the uncontrolled proliferation of melanocytes and poses a challenge diagnostically because neoplastic lesions can mimic benign lesions, which are much more common in the population. Doctors, when they suspect the presence of melanoma, arrange for its removal and the performance of a histological examination to ascertain its diagnosis; in cases where the dermatoscopic examination is indicative of benignity, however, after the lesion is removed, histological examination is not always performed, a very dangerous occurrence and a harbinger of further medico-legal problems. The authors present a court litigation case of an “alleged” failure to diagnose malignant melanoma in a patient who died of brain metastases from melanoma in the absence of a certain location of the primary tumor: the physician who had removed a benign lesion a few months earlier was sued, and only thanks to the presence of photographic documentation was the health care provider able to prove his extraneousness. The aim of this paper is to formulate a proposal for a dermatological protocol to be followed in cases of excisions of benign skin lesions with a twofold purpose: on the one hand, to be able to prove, in a judicial context, the right action on the part of the sanitarians; on the other hand, to avoid the rise of so-called “defensive medicine”.",

    "Title": "Multiple Vulvar Polyps in Pregnancy: A Benign Disease With a Challenging Diagnosis",
    "Abstract": "Fibroepithelial polyps are common benign skin tumors of mesenchymal and ectodermal origin, characterized by a connective tissue core covered by a benign squamous epithelium.1 Also known as acrochorda or skin tags, they are usually found in skin folds, such as the neck, axilla, submandibular, or inguinal areas. Fibroepithelial polyps can also be found in the genital tract, usually in the vagina,2-4 showing in selected cases in pregnancy the aspects of polyposis.5,6 Fibroepithelial polyps of the vulva (FEVP) are rarely reported lesions, almost exclusively described as single, large polyps.6 Typically asymptomatic, they can cause discomfort, or seldom bleeding, when inflamed. These tumors may appear from small, flesh-colored or hyperpigmented, papillomatous growths resembling condylomas to large pedunculated tumors.5 Due to this wide range of morphologic appearances that in some cases may overlap with those of malignant neoplasms2,6,7 or infective diseases, a biopsy is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. Reaching the correct diagnosis is important to determine the extent of surgical resection and to avoid overtreatment. In the present report, we describe a case of multiple FEVP in pregnancy, not involving the vaginal mucosa, with incomplete regression after spontaneous delivery. A skin excision allowed treatment with good vulvar reconstitution.",

    "Abstract": "Malignant melanoma (MM) is the “great mime” of dermatopathology, and it can present such rare variants that even the most experienced pathologist might miss or misdiagnose them. Naevoid melanoma (NM), which accounts for about 1% of all MM cases, is a constant challenge, and when it is not diagnosed in a timely manner, it can even lead to death. In recent years, artificial intelligence has revolutionised much of what has been achieved in the biomedical field, and what once seemed distant is now almost incorporated into the diagnostic therapeutic flow chart. In this paper, we present the results of a machine learning approach that applies a fast random forest (FRF) algorithm to a cohort of naevoid melanomas in an attempt to understand if and how this approach could be incorporated into the business process modelling and notation (BPMN) approach. The FRF algorithm provides an innovative approach to formulating a clinical protocol oriented toward reducing the risk of NM misdiagnosis. The work provides the methodology to integrate FRF into a mapped clinical process.",

    "Title": "Obesity does not increase the risk of side effects and complications of egg retrieval: delaying oocyte retrieval in obese patients is not a good strategy",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Obesity is one of the main concerns for public health and is becoming an increasingly widespread problem worldwide. Women are more likely to require a cesarean section and have a longer hospital stay after delivery. Excess body weight can interfere with ovulation and make it more difficult for embryos to implant in the uterus. A high body mass index (BMI) has controversial effects on the outcomes of medically assisted reproduction treatments (IVF) and, if careful counseling is not performed, medical-legal risks may be incurred. While some researchers argue that obesity does not particularly affect ART outcomes, other studies claim that a high BMI does not interfere with embryonic development. Both the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) has stated that there is no clear evidence supporting a BMI limit for IVF treatment and that each patient should be evaluated on an individual basis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether performing in vitro fertilization on these patients increases the risk of medical, surgical, and anesthetic complications of oocyte retrieval. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2022, all patients with BMI higher than 25 were enrolled in the study (n=766). Complications and risks related to oocyte retrieval were evaluated, and patients were divided according to BMI groups. RESULTS: With the one-way ANOVA test, all groups were compared with the control group, and none showed statistically significant differences, only the number of produced embryos in the BMI group between 30-34.9 was lower and statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Only one study has analyzed these aspects, mainly focusing on the need for anesthesia drugs and any related complications, and the same author reported greater difficulty in performing oocyte retrieval. The same study recorded an increase in incomplete oocyte retrievals. Our work does not confirm any of these impressions.",

    "Abstract": "Thyroid surgeries can often lead to operative complications, sometimes with consequences on the patient’s health. This often leads to claims for compensation but the assessments of consultants and judges are not always objective. Based on these considerations, the authors analyzed forty-seven sentences issued between 2013 and 2022 regarding claims of alleged medical malpractice. This analysis aims to examine the cases presented in the sentences and the evaluations proposed by the judges to offer ideas for objective evaluation by the legislation in force in Italy.",

    "Title": "Ultrasound Control of Cervical Regeneration after Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone: Results of an Innovative Measurement Technique",
    "Abstract": "The objective of this research is to evaluate cervical regeneration after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) through the identification of a new sonographic reference point at the level of the uterine margins. In the period March 2021–January 2022, a total of 42 patients affected by CIN 2–3 were treated with LLETZ at the University Hospital of Bari (Italy). Before performing LLETZ, cervical length and volume were measured with trans-vaginal 3D ultrasound. From the multiplanar images, the cervical volume was obtained using the Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis (VOCAL™) program with manual contour mode. The line that connects the points where the common trunk of the uterine arteries reaches the uterus splitting into the ascending major branch and the cervical branch was considered as the upper limit of the cervical canal. From the acquired 3D volume, the length and the volume of the cervix were measured between this line and the external uterine os. Immediately after LLETZ, the removed cone was measured using Vernier’s caliper, and before fixation in formalin, the volume of the excised tissue was evaluated by the fluid displacement technique based on the Archimedes principle. The proportion of excised cervical volume was 25.50 ± 17.43%. The volume and the height of the excised cone were 1.61 ± 0.82 mL and 9.65 ± 2.49 mm corresponding to 14.74 ± 11.91% and 36.26 ± 15.49% of baseline values, respectively. The volume and length of the residual cervix were also assessed using 3D ultrasound up to the sixth month after excision. At 6 weeks, about 50% of cases reported an unchanged or lower cervical volume compared to the baseline pre-LLETZ values. The average percentage of volume regeneration in examined patients was equal to 9.77 ± 55.33%. In the same period, the cervical length regeneration rate was 69.41 ± 14.8%. Three months after LLETZ, a volume regeneration rate of 41.36 ± 28.31% was found. For the length, an average regeneration rate of 82.48 ± 15.25% was calculated. Finally, at 6 months, the percentage of regeneration of the excised volume was 90.99 ± 34.91%. The regrowth percentage of the cervical length was 91.07 ± 8.03%. The cervix measurement technique that we have proposed has the advantage of identifying an unequivocal reference point in 3D cervical measurement. Ultrasound 3D evaluation could be useful in the clinical practice to evaluate the cervical tissue deficit and express the “potential of cervical regeneration” as well as provide the surgeon useful information about the cervical length.",

    "Abstract": "Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare type of mesenchymal tumor. Suspecting LMS before surgery is crucial for proper patient management. Ultrasound is the primary method for assessing myometrial lesions. The overlapping of clinical, laboratory, as well as ultrasound features between fibroids and LMS makes differential diagnosis difficult. We report our single-center experience in ultrasound imaging assessment of LMS patients, highlighting that misleading findings such as shadowing and absent or minimal vascularization may also occur in LMS. To avoid mistakes, a comprehensive evaluation of potentially overlapping ultrasound features is necessary in preoperative ultrasound evaluations of all myometrial tumors.",

    "Title": "Prognostic Role of CDKN2A Deletion and p53 Expression and Association With MIPIb in Mantle Cell Lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "Introduction: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare type of lymphoma, which despite improvements in therapies in recent decades, remains an incurable disease. There is currently no reliable marker of chemoresistance available. In this study, we investigated the prognostic role of MIPIb and the association with biological markers including SOX11, p53 expression, Ki-67, and CDKN2A. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was focused on 23 patients with newly diagnosed classical MCL, treated at the University Hospital of Bari (Italy) between January 2006 and June 2019. Results: We identified a MIPIb value ≥ 5.4440 as a prognostic parameter that correlates with p53 expression and CDKN2A deletion. We also observed that patients with p53 overexpression had a significantly higher MIPIb (5.52 ± 0.53) which in 80% of patients had a value higher than 5.4440. On the other hand, CDKN2A deletion was found more frequently (75%) associated with MIPIb ≥5.4440. Only the CDKN2A deletion was associated with a higher proliferation index, with 66.7% of samples having Ki67 ≥30%. From the survival analysis we found that patients with p53 overexpression and CDKN2A deletion have a significantly worse prognosis with a median overall survival of 50 (P = .012) and 52 months (P = .018), respectively. Conclusion: p53 expression and CDKN2A deletion represent a reliable pretreatment prognostic factor that identifies patients who do not benefit from currently used immunochemotherapy-based therapies and who are candidates for diversified treatments with the aim of improving prognosis. The MIPIb represents a prognostic index that correlates well with these biological alterations and can be used in clinical practice as their surrogate.",

    "Title": "Partially Dedifferentiated Primitive Malignant Melanoma with Pseudo-Angiomatous Features: A Case Report with Review of the Literature",
    "Abstract": "Malignant melanoma (MM) is traditionally known as the “great mime” of human pathology, as it is potentially capable of imitating the most disparate neoplasms. It is known that in addition to the more classic histotypes of MM, there are also rare forms, including angiomatoid MM. Similarly, it has been amply demonstrated in the literature that MM is capable of dedifferentiating, losing melanocytic lineage markers, constituting a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist. Although 5 cases of primary angiomatoid MM have been described in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, no cases of dedifferentiated melanoma with pseudo-angiomatoid aspects have ever been described. In this paper, we present a very rare case of partially dedifferentiated MM in which the most dedifferentiated component lost melanocytic lineage immunohistochemical markers and assumed a pseudo-angiomatous morphology. Given the rarity of the case, we carried out a literature review of similar cases described, trying to draw new future perspectives not only about this particular variant of MM but also about the widest field of dedifferentiation/undifferentiation of MM.",

    "Title": "Diagnostic Methods in Forensic Pathology: A New Sign in Death from Hanging",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of studying vital injuries at the sternal head insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the medico-legal assessment of death by hanging. Materials and Methods: Study material was obtained from eight bodies of people who died from hanging. The control group included as many specimens collected from people who died from traumatic causes other than hanging (precipitation from medium to large heights and traffic accidents). The structures under study were examined histologically with a BX-51 light microscope (Olympus). An analysis of the extravasated erythrocytes was performed by counting the number per mm2 in the histologic section on 10 HPF (400×), and Student’s t-test for a comparison of the averages was applied for all parametric values. The authors noted that the key finding, indicative of the subject’s viability at the time of discontinuation, was the presence of recent hemorrhagic infiltrate (in the absence of hemosiderin) at the tendon insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the proximal part of the muscle itself. Results: All specimens tested were positive for the presence of hemorrhagic infiltrate at the portions tested in a statistically significant manner. In contrast, in the control cases there was no or, where present, no statistically significant (p < 0.05) presence of recent hemorrhagic infiltrate. The limitation of the study is the low number of samples examined. In any case, the results obtained are strongly indicative of the possibility of using this type of forensic pathological investigation in cases where there is a doubt in terms of a differential diagnosis between hanging (suicidal type) and suspension of a corpse in a simulation of hanging.",

    "Title": "Heat Stroke in the Work Environment: Case Report of an Underestimated Phenomenon",
    "Abstract": "Average global temperatures continue to trend upward, and this phenomenon is part of the more complex climate change taking place on our planet over the past century. Human health is directly affected by environmental conditions, not only because of communicable diseases that are clearly affected by climate, but also because of the relationship between rising temperatures and increased morbidity for psychiatric diseases. As global temperatures and the number of extreme days increase, so does the risk associated with all those acute illnesses related to these factors. For example, there is a correlation between out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and heat. Then, there are pathologies that recognize excessive heat as the main etiological agent. This is the case with so-called “heat stroke”, a form of hyperthermia accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, which causes multi-organ dysfunction and sometimes death. Starting with a case that came to their attention of a young man in good general health who died while working unloading fruit crates from a truck, the authors wanted to express some thoughts on the need to adapt the world of work, including work-specific hazards, in order to protect the worker exposed to this “new risk” and develop multidisciplinary adaptation strategies that incorporate climatology, indoor/building environments, energy use, regulatory perfection of work and human thermal comfort.",

    "Title": "Machine learning applied to MRI evaluation for the detection of lymph node metastasis in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: Concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CCRT) plus brachytherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by radical hysterectomy is an alternative for patients with stage IB2–IIB disease. Therefore, the correct pre-treatment staging is essential to the proper management of this disease. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard examination but studies about MRI accuracy in the detection of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in LACC patients show conflicting data. Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a promising tool for unraveling complex non-linear relationships between patient attributes that cannot be solved by traditional statistical methods. Here we investigated whether ML might improve the accuracy of MRI in the detection of LNM in LACC patients. Methods: We analyzed retrospectively LACC patients who underwent NACT and radical hysterectomy from 2015 to 2020. Demographic, clinical and MRI characteristics before and after NACT were collected, as well as information about post-surgery histopathology. Random features elimination wrapper was used to determine an attribute core set. A ML algorithm, namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was trained and validated with tenfold cross-validation. The performances of the algorithm were assessed. Results: Our analysis included n.92 patients. FIGO stage was IB2 in n.4/92 (4.3%), IB3 in n.42/92 (45%), IIA1 in n.1/92 (1.1%), IIA2 in n.16/92 (17.4%) and IIB in n.29/92 (31.5%). Despite detected neither at pre-treatment and post-treatment MRI in any patients, LNM occurred in n.16/92 (17%) patients. The attribute core set used to train ML algorithms included grading, histotypes, age, parity, largest diameter of lesion at either pre- and post-treatment MRI, presence/absence of fornix infiltration at pre-treatment MRI and FIGO stage. XGBoost showed a good performance (accuracy 89%, precision 83%, recall 78%, AUROC 0.79). Conclusions: We developed an accurate model to predict LNM in LACC patients in NACT, based on a ML algorithm requiring few easy-to-collect attributes.",

    "Title": "Hormone replacement therapy in BRCA mutation carriers: how shall we do no harm?",
    "Abstract": "Women with a BRCA mutation have an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the only effective strategy to reduce this risk. Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is recommended between the ages of 35 and 40 for women carriers of BRCA1 and between the ages of 40 and 45 for women carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Most women undergo this procedure prior to their natural menopause subsequently developing an anticipated lack of hormones. This condition affects the quality of life and longevity, while it is more pronounced in women carrying a BRCA1 mutation compared to BRCA2 because they are likely to have surgery earlier. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the only strategy able to significantly compensate for the loss of ovarian hormone production and counteract menopausal symptoms. There is strong evidence that short-term HRT use does not increase the risk of breast cancer among women with a BRCA1 mutation. Few data are available on BRCA2 mutation carriers. Therefore, BRCA mutation carriers require careful counseling about the outcomes of their RRSO, including menopausal symptoms and/or the fear associated with HRT use.",

    "Title": "PReferentially Expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME): preliminary communication on a translational tool able to early detect Oral Malignant Melanoma (OMM)",
    "Abstract": "Oral malignant melanoma (OMM) has a prevalence less than 1% of all melanomas and it commonly develops on the oral mucosa following a slow and unspecific transformation of unstable melanocytic lesions, often resulting in a diagnostic delay. The marker PReferentially Expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME) seems to be a valid tool to investigate the biological and histological nature of cutaneous melanocytic lesions, but to date its use to characterize pigmented lesions in the oral cavity is largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to create preliminary knowledge on the PRAME expression in OMM, and to compare its expression respect to other dysplastic pigmented lesions of the oral cavity. Interestingly, PRAME has been demonstrated to be reliable in the clinical conditions investigated in our pilot study; in fact, it has clearly differentiated the cases of Melanoma, which showed diffuse and intense positivity (score 6+/7+) to PRAME, from the other melanocytic nevi, which resulted to be mainly negative to PRAME. This means a better differential diagnosis, a reliable early diagnosis and a proper clinical/surgical management of the oncological lesions. In conclusion, PRAME can be a valid qualitative marker for differential diagnosis, not only in cutaneous melanomas, but also in malignant melanoma of the entire head and neck area.",

    "Title": "Incidence of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the cervix before and after the COVID-19 pandemic",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic had significant effects on healthcare systems worldwide, including the disruption of routine screening programs for cervical cancer. This study aimed to compare the incidence of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN)2 and CIN3 lesions, adenocarcinoma, and squamous carcinoma of the cervix before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed using archive data from the Policlinico di Bari, Unit of Gynecology and Obstetrics. The study included patients who tested positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) at the level I screening test (HPV test) and were subsequently referred to level II screening, which involves the Papanicolaou (Pap) test and colposcopic examination. We excluded individuals who did not comply with the recommended follow-up, patients with low-risk HPV infection, those with autoimmune diseases, oncologic diseases, or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapies. The time period spanned from January 2020 to December 2022. The incidence of CIN2/CIN3 lesions, adenocarcinoma, and squamous carcinoma of the cervix was compared between the pre-screening period (2017-2019) and the post-screening period (2020-2022). Results: The study comprised a cohort of 1558 consecutive European sexually active women with a median age of 34 years (range 25-65) who underwent colposcopic evaluation of the uterine cervix as a level II screening program. The comparison between the pre-screening and post-screening periods showed an increase in the incidence of CIN2/CIN3 lesions, rising from 23.9 to 63.3 per 100 000 (HR 2.62, 95% CI 1.64 to 4.20; p<0.001). Additionally, although there was an absolute increase in the incidence of cervical carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, the comparison did not reach statistical significance (squamous carcinoma: 2017-2019, 2.5 per 100 000; 2020-2022 3.4 per 100 000, p=0.72; adenocarcinoma: 2017-2019, 3.5 per 100 000; 2020-2022 7.6 per 100 000, p=0.24). Conclusion: This study showed a significant increase in the incidence rate of CIN2/CIN3 lesions after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings may be attributed to the temporary suspension of follow-up programs during the pandemic, although the study does not rule out direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the risk of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions of the cervix.",

In the early 2000s, the need emerged to create an international genetic database for forensic purposes. This paper describes a judicial investigation of skeletal remains to identify the subject using various methods. The anthropological examination of the remains allowed identification of the Caucasoid (European) ethnic group, a height of 156 ± 4 cm, and an age between 47 and 50 years. The genetic profiles obtained from typing several microsatellites made it possible to evaluate the compatibility between the skeletal remains and the suspected decedent. To identify the remains, the two extrapolated genetic profiles were compared. The case described highlights the central role of forensic genetics in identifying skeleton remains by means of comparison.",

    "Abstract": "The investigation studied the enkephalinergic neuro fibers (En) contained in the Lower Uterine Segment (LUS) during the prolonged dystocic labor (PDL) with Labor Neuraxial Analgesia (LNA). PDL is generally caused by fetal head malpositions in the Occiput Posterior Position (OPP), Persistent Occiput Posterior Position (POPP), in a transverse position (OTP), and asynclitism (A), and it is detected by Intrapartum Ultrasonography (IU). The En were detected in the LUS samples picked up during cesarean section (CS) of 38 patients undergoing urgent CS in PDL, compared to 37 patients submitted to elective CS. Results were statistically evaluated to understand the differences in En morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by fluorescence microscopy (FM). The LUS samples analysis showed an important reduction in En in LUS of CS for the PDL group, in comparison with the elective CS group. The LUS overdistension, by fetal head malpositions (OPP, OTP, A) and malrotations, lead to dystocia, modification of vascularization, and En reduction. The En reduction in PDL suggests that drugs used during the LNA, usually local anesthetics and opioids, cannot control the “dystocic pain”, that differs from normal labor pain. The IU administration in labor and the consequent diagnosis of dystocia suggest stopping the numerous and ineffective top-up drug administration during LNA, and to shift the labor to operative vaginal delivery or CS.",

Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: A teaching and university hospital. Patients: Women with RPOC. Interventions: Office -HM with ‘Truclear 5 C’. Material and methods: Twenty-two consecutive patients presenting with trophoblastic residue retention after miscarriage and interruption of pregnancy or placenta remnants after cesarean section or delivery were enrolled. These women underwent office-HM with ‘Truclear 5 C’. Primary outcomes were median time and rate of hospitalization. The quality of the specimen was also analyzed. A hysteroscopic second look for IUAs was performed. Results: Mean procedure time was six minutes (SD ± 5). Tissue samples had a mean collection size 2.5 cm3+0.9. 38% of the samples had spotting or abnormal vaginal discharge. Dilatation of the cervical canal was not performed in any case. Second-look hysteroscopy did not show any de novo IUAs in any of the enrolled patients. Conclusions: In the hysteroscopic treatment of RPOC, HM is a valid choice in an office setting without the use of cervical dilatation.

    "Abstract": "Mpox Virus (MPXV) is a zoonotic infectious disease first identified in 1970 in rural villages in rainforest areas of central and western Africa when smallpox was in the final stages of eradication. Since May 2022, cases and sustained transmission chains of monkeypox have been reported for the first time in countries where the disease is not endemic and without cases having direct or immediate epidemiological links to areas of West or Central Africa (travel, importation of mammals). On 23 July 2022, WHO declared monkeypox a “Public Emergency of International Concern” (PHEIC). In this paper, we report two cases of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-confirmed MPXV infection. A 39-year-old Italian male came to our attention for a suspected herpetic infection, fever, headache, and malaise, which were followed by the development of an erythematous plaque covered by vesicles on the chin, an oval ulcer with a white peripheral border on the lower lip, and a central erosive area and three pustules on the arms and trunk. During the physical examination, cervical lymphadenopathy was also detected. PCR investigation of the patient and his partner confirmed the presence of MPXV infection. Our report describes a possible clinical feature of Mpox disease and illustrates the challenge of a disease that seems to present itself in different ways.",

    "Abstract": "Minimally invasive treatment of uterine fibroids usually requires a power morcellation, which could be associated with several complications. A rare sequela is disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis. Indeed, recurrence or metastasis in these cases could be attributed to iatrogenic or under-evaluation of primary tumors, although a subset of cases is a sporadic sample of biological progression. We present an extremely rare case of a patient who underwent laparoscopic morcellation and after 12 years developed a pelvic leiomyosarcoma with two omental metastases, disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis with a parasite leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei and a parasite cellular leiomyoma simultaneously. The diagnosis was predicted preoperatively by an expert sonographer who recognized the ultrasound characteristics of uterine sarcoma and the localization of some of the masses, so the patient was referred to the gynaecological oncologists who could appropriately treat her. We present here a case report and a systematic review that could be a useful tool for further discussion and future clinical practice guidelines.",

    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused an increasing number of corporate layoffs and downsizing, as well as causing many employees to be absent due to illness, with inevitable consequences on the health of active workers both from a physical point of view, due to the need to make up for staff and organizational shortages, and from a mental point of view, due to the inevitable consequences related to the uncertainty of the social context. This context has certainly caused an increase in work-related stress, which is the pathological outcome of a process that affects workers who are subjected to excessive (emotional-relational or high or low or inadequate activity) or improper work loads. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the main aspects of this issue, through the analysis proposed by two case reports, both of which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which occupational stress emerged as an etiological agent in the determinism of death.",

    "Title": "Treatment of Severe Atopic Dermatitis with Dupilumab in Three Patients with Renal Diseases",
    "Abstract": "Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease that can affect patients’ quality of life. Dupilumab is the first biologic agent approved for the treatment of patients with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD and its mechanism of action is based on the inhibition of the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 signaling. There are only a few data on the safety of dupilumab in AD patients with comorbidities, including kidney disorders. Materials and Methods: Descriptive retrospective series of three patients with chronic kidney diseases (Alport syndrome, IgA nephropathy, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis, respectively) receiving dupilumab for their concomitant severe AD. Results: Treatment with a standard dosage of dupilumab caused a relevant improvement of AD in all patients without any adverse events or worsening of renal function. In a patient with severe renal failure, the drug was effective and well tolerated without the need for any dose adjustments, also after the initiation of peritoneal dialytic treatment. Conclusion: Our case series suggests the use of dupilumab as an effective and safe treatment for AD patients suffering from renal diseases, although additional studies are required to confirm such preliminary findings.",

    "Title": "Adverse Maternal Outcomes in Pregnant Women Affected by Severe-Critical COVID-19 Illness: Correlation with Vaccination Status in the Time of Different Viral Strains’ Dominancy",
    "Abstract": "This is a monocentric and cross-sectional study conducted at the COVID-19 Division of the Obstetrical and Gynecological Unit and Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of Policlinico di Bari, in Bari, Italy, between September 2020 and April 2022. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of severe-critical COVID-19 illness requiring access to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) among 287 pregnant patients, and possible correlations between the SARS-CoV-2 variants, the specific pandemic wave (dominated by wild, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron strains), and severe-critical adverse maternal outcomes. The prevalence of severe-critical COVID-19 illness was 2.8% (8/287), reaching 4.9% (8/163) excluding the 4th wave (Omicron dominant). The Delta variant determined the highest risk ratio and odds for access to the ICU due to severe-critical COVID-19-related symptoms compared to the other variants (wild, Alpha, Omicron). During the third wave (Delta), the ICU cases underwent a higher rate of hyperimmune plasma infusion (75%), antibiotic therapy (75%), and remdesivir (33%); all of the patients were intubated. During the Omicron wave, the patients were asymptomatic or with few symptoms: most of them (70%) were vaccinated with a median of two doses. The maternal outcome worsened in the case of Alpha and, especially, Delta variants for severe-critical COVID-19-related symptoms and ICU access.",

    "Title": "PRAME Immuno-Expression in Cutaneous Sebaceous Carcinoma: A Single Institutional Experience",
    "Abstract": "Background: In recent years, great research interest has been directed to the diagnostic, therapeutic and marker role of Preferentially expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) in the setting of various human neoplasms. Although it has been extensively studied mainly in the differential diagnosis setting of melanocytic pigmented lesions, still very few papers have analyzed the usefulness or otherwise of PRAME in the context of other non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). (2) Methods: In this paper, we report the data of our experience of 21 cases of sebaceous carcinoma (SC) classified in the three WHO grade and collected in the period between January 2005 and 31 October 2022, on which immunostaining for PRAME was performed; Non-parametric Mann–Whitney test for non-normally distributed values was performed. A comparison was made of the means between the three study groups (grade I, II and III). A value of p ≤ 0.05 was set as statistically significant (3) Results: Only seven cases (33.3%) were positive with an immunoscore of 2+/3+ for intensity and 1+/2+ for percentage cells positivity, while 14 cases (66.6%) were totally or nearly totally negative for PRAME with a few of sebaceous-like cells positive with an immunoscore of 1+. Eight cases of SC grade I were immunostaining for PRAME, a level of the cytoplasm of foci of sebaceous differentiation with a significant statical value (p < 0.0001) with respect to ten cases of SC grade II; furthermore, the eight cases of grade I were positive for PRAME in the same areas respect the 3 cases of SC grade III (p = 0.0303). There were no statistical significance between the 10 cases of grade II and 3 cases of grade III (p = 0.2028); (4) Conclusions: PRAME not seems to add particular information in the case of histopathological diagnostics of SC where other markers, including adipophylline, can be quite indicative. It seems, on the other hand, that PRAME can be useful in the subclassification setting of sebaceous carcinoma in grades I–II–III according to the directives of the latest WHO 2018, highlighting the foci of mature sebaceous differentiation most present in grades 1–2 and almost completely absent in grade 3 of the SC.",

    "Title": "Evaluation of the ideal vaginal Progesterone effectiveness doses for luteal support in embryo thawing cycles after endometrial preparation without using the GnRh analogue",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles require the use of luteal phase support (LPS) for supporting implantation, endometrial and embryo maturity. Individualized LPS should be chosen according to the used endometrial preparation protocol. The aim of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of two different vaginal Progesterone doses for women who underwent FET cycle and the same endometrial preparation without using the GnRh analogue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 607 women who underwent FET cycle were included in the study. 305 patients received luteal support with 600 mg/ day vaginal Progesterone and 302 patients were treated with 800 mg/day of vaginal Progesterone. RESULTS: In the 800 mg/day group, the mean serum Progesterone concentration on the day of embryo transfer was higher than in the 600 mg group (14.00±6.18 ng/mL and 12.22±5.39, respectively, p < 0.001). Moreover, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) positive and ongoing pregnancy rates were higher in the group of patients who received LPS with 800 mg/day of Progesterone than in the group of patients treated with 600 mg/day of Progesterone. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing FET cycles following endometrial preparation made without previously using the GnRh analogue, 800 mg doses of vaginal Progesterone as LPS improve reproductive outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "The incidence of epithelial tumours of the ovary ranges from 9–17 per 100,000 and is the highest in high-income countries, with the exception of the Japan. The coexistence of neoplastic Müllerian epithelial and sex cord-stromal elements within a single tumour is extremely rare. We describe the case of a 74-year-old woman with a voluminous left adnexal formation. Pre-operative assessment with ultrasound evaluation made a suspicious diagnosis of benignity of the lesion. Bilateral salpingo-ovariectomy was performed. Intraoperative frozen section analysis results in the diagnosis of fibrothecoma in the context of serous cystadenoma. The diagnosis is confirmed by histological examination. Some authors suggest labelling this phenomenon as collision tumours.",

    "Abstract": "Malignant melanoma (MM) is known to be the great mimic in dermatopathology. Over time, several variants have been described, not all of which have repercussions on the clinical/oncological management of the affected patient. The existence, however, of these alternative forms of MM is of great interest to the pathologist, as they are potentially capable of inducing diagnostic errors affecting the diagnostic-therapeutic care pathway (PDTC). In this paper, we present a very rare case of polymorphic MM, in which five different morphological aspects coexisted in the same lesion, confirmed by immunohistochemical investigation and by RT-PCR for mutation of the BRAF gene and discuss the importance of correct recognition of these different morphological features to avoid misdiagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "The advent of vaccines has drastically reduced the incidence, morbidity, and mortality related to COVID-19, and with the increase in the number of vaccinated subjects, there have been reports of some adverse events, including skin reactions. In this paper, we report a clinical case of Purpura Annularis Telangiectodes of Majocchi following a third-dose administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Almost 30 days after the third dose, the patient presented erythematous annular patches on the lower limbs with purpuric peripheral areas and a central clearing with no other symptoms. A dermoscopic examination showed capillaritis, reddish-brown dot-clods on a coppery-red background caused by leaky capillaries. To date, the causes of Majocchi’s disease are not well-defined; in the literature, three vaccination-related cases have been reported: one after a flu vaccination and two after an anti-SARS-CoV-2 one. Dermatologists should be trained to promptly recognize these clinical manifestations after vaccination, which will likely become a common finding in daily clinical practice, especially given the large diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations.",

    "Title": "Gastro-intestinal metastasis from Melanoma: Clinico-pathological clues",
    "Abstract": "Introduction: Metastasis from melanoma in the gastro-intestinal tract is a frequent event but, in the absence of an adequate clinical context and oncological anamnesis, it could be misdiagnosed by the pathologists. Moreover, amelanotic and/or poorly differentiated metastasis from melanoma in the gastro-intestinal tract can be easily underestimated. Materials and methods: We describe the histological features of gastro-intestinal metastasis from melanoma in a multi-centric cohort of 49 patients. In 24/49 patients, we were able to compare histological findings such as the growth pattern and the melanotic pigment also in the primary melanoma. Results: The epithelioid pattern is the most common growth pattern observed in gastro-intestinal metastasis (57 %), followed by the mixed pattern (41 %) and the spindled pattern (2 %). We documented a discordant growth pattern between metastasis and primary in 9/24 cases and the absence of melanotic pigment in 8/49 cases. Discussion: Our experience highlights that pathologists should take into account the possibility of gastro-intestinal metastasis from melanoma also in cases with spindled-cells/amelanotic lesions, without a previous anamnesis of melanoma asportation, and in cases of a discordant growth pattern with the primary. A correct clinical integration and an aware immunohistochemical approach are imperative to best manage the bioptic sample in order to investigate the biological profiling and therefore plan a personalizated therapy.",

    "Title": "Lactobacillus crispatus M247 oral administration: Is it really an effective strategy in the management of papillomavirus-infected women?",
    "Abstract": "Background: Recent studies have shown the importance of the microbiota in women's health. Indeed, the persistence of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-related lesions in patients with dysbiosis can be the antechamber to cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether long term administration of oral Lactobacillus crispatus can restore eubiosis in women with HPV infections and hence achieve viral clearance. Methods: In total, 160 women affected by HPV infections were enrolled at the Department of Gynecological Obstetrics of “San Paolo” Hospital, Italy between February 2021 and February 2022. The women were randomly assigned to two groups, one in treatment with oral Lactobacillus crispatus M247 (group 1, n = 80) versus the control group, that hence only in follow-up (Group 2, n = 80). Results: After a median follow-up of 12 months (range 10–30 months), the likelihood of resolving HPV-related cytological anomalies was higher in patients in treatment with the long term oral probiotic (group 1) versus the group that perfom only follow-up (group 2) (60.5% vs. 41.3%, p = 0.05). Total HPV clearance was shown in 9.3% of patients undergoing only follow-up compared to 15.3% of patients in the group taking long term oral Lactobacillus crispatus M247 (p = 0.34). However, the percentage of HPV-negative patients, assessed with the HPV-DNA test, documented at the end of the study period was not significantly different from the control group. Conclusions: Despite the limitations of our analysis, we found a higher percentage of clearance of PAP-smear abnormalities in patients who took long term oral Lactobacillus crispatus M247 than in the control group. Larger studies are warranted, but we believe that future research should be aimed in this direction. Trial registration This study is retrospectively registered.",

    "Abstract": "Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rare neoplasm described for the first time by Enzinger in 1979, and classified by World Health Organization 2020 as intermediate malignant potential neoplasm. It mostly occurs in the subcutis and is characterized by varying proportions of epithelioid, ovoid and spindle cells in a nodular and syncytial growth pattern, with some hemorrhagic pseudovascular spaces. In this paper, we report the clinical case of a 62-year-old man who presented with AFH on the right arm, and relapsed three years after first surgical excision. After a further three years, the patient presented with an intramuscular localization of AFH, and 12 months after this, a pulmonary metastasis of AFH was diagnosed. Given the rarity of the spreading of AFH, we performed Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and we detected EWSR1::CREB1 gene fusion.",

    "Title": "A machine learning approach applied to gynecological ultrasound to predict progression-free survival in ovarian cancer patients",
    "Abstract": "In a growing number of social and clinical scenarios, machine learning (ML) is emerging as a promising tool for implementing complex multi-parametric decision-making algorithms. Regarding ovarian cancer (OC), despite the standardization of features that can support the discrimination of ovarian masses into benign and malignant, there is a lack of accurate predictive modeling based on ultrasound (US) examination for progression-free survival (PFS). This retrospective observational study analyzed patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who were followed in a tertiary center from 2018 to 2019. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, information about the surgery and post-surgery histopathology were collected. Additionally, we recorded data about US examinations according to the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) classification. Our study aimed to realize a tool to predict 12 month PFS in patients with OC based on a ML algorithm applied to gynecological ultrasound assessment. Proper feature selection was used to determine an attribute core set. Three different machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RFF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), were then trained and validated with five-fold cross-validation to predict 12 month PFS. Our analysis included n. 64 patients and 12 month PFS was achieved by 46/64 patients (71.9%). The attribute core set used to train machine learning algorithms included age, menopause, CA-125 value, histotype, FIGO stage and US characteristics, such as major lesion diameter, side, echogenicity, color score, major solid component diameter, presence of carcinosis. RFF showed the best performance (accuracy 93.7%, precision 90%, recall 90%, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.92). We developed an accurate ML model to predict 12 month PFS.",

    "Title": "PRAME Immunoexpression in 275 Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions: A Double Institutional Experience",
    "Abstract": "In recent years, the preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) has also been used in the histopathological diagnosis of melanocytic lesions, in order to understand if it could constitute a valid, inexpensive, and useful resource in dermatopathological fields. We performed a double-center study to evaluate whether the data on the usefulness and possible limitations of PRAME could also be confirmed by our group. From 1 December 2021 to 29 March 2022, we collected 275 cases of melanocytic lesions that were immunostained with PRAME (Ab219650) and rabbit monoclonal antibody (Abcam). To better correlate the PRAME expression with its nature (benign, uncertain potential for malignancy, or malignant), we categorized PRAME tumor cells’ percentage positivity and intensity of immunostaining in a cumulative score obtained by adding the quartile of positive tumor cells (0, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) to the PRAME expression intensity in tumor cells (0, 1+, 2+, 3+). Of these 275 lesions, 136 were benign, 12 were of uncertain potential for malignancy (MELTUMP or SAMPUS or SPARK nevus), and 127 were malignant. The immunoexpression of PRAME was completely negative in 125/136 benign lesions (91.9%), with only a few positive melanocytes (1+) and intensity 1+ in the remaining 11 cases (8.1%). Of the 127 cases of melanoma (superficial spreading, lentigo maligna, and pagetoid histotypes), PRAME was strongly positive in 104/127 cases (81.8%) with intensity 4+ and 3+. In 17 cases (13.3%; melanoma spindle and nevoid cell histotypes), PRAME was positive in percentage 2+ and with intensity ranging from 2+ to 3+. In 7 cases (5.5%) of desmoplastic melanoma, PRAME was 1+ positive and/or completely negative. Of the 12 cases of lesions with uncertain potential for malignancy, the immunoexpression of PRAME was much more heterogeneous and irregularly distributed throughout the lesion. These data are perfectly in agreement with the current literature, and they demonstrate that the reliability of PRAME is quite high, but its use cannot cause physicians to disregard the morphological information and the execution of other ancillary immunohistochemical stains such as Melan-A, HMB-45, MiTF, and SOX-10.",

    "Title": "Communications Is Time for Care: An Italian Monocentric Survey on Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Risk Information as Part of Cervical Cancer Screening",
    "Abstract": "Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection could be considered a social disease, both for its high incidence, especially in younger subjects, and for the risk of neoplastic evolution linked to viral infection. Therefore, the National Health System, in collaboration with the state, must help women to understand the oncological risk of HPV and suitable methods of prevention. We conducted an Italian monocentric survey on HPV risk information as part of cervical cancer screening. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to 200 women with high-risk positive HPV and low-grade cervical lesions during second-level cervical cancer screening at the Gynecology and Obstetrics Unit of the “San Paolo” Hospital. From this survey, the need to improve communication for patients has emerged, as currently it is not exhaustive. In response to this need, organizational changes have been implemented to centralize the moment of counseling in the second levels of screening and to improve the training of health workers in level I as well as family doctors. In addition, psychological support was also proposed to patients who requested it, as was the dissemination of material such as that produced by GISCI (Italian Cervico-Carcinoma Screening Group) and updated in May 2018, which provides 100 answers to questions on HPV in order to achieve effective and comprehensive communication. This investigation requires further development, and the expansion of this investigation to the multicenter level is already underway. Therefore, this survey will represent a cornerstone for further discussion on the topic considering the necessity of appropriate communication in the oncological context.",

    "Title": "Effects of Oral Supplementation with Myo-Inositol and D-Chiro-Inositol on Ovarian Functions in Female Long-Term Survivors of Lymphoma: Results from a Prospective Case–Control Analysis",
    "Abstract": "The progressive improvement of lymphoma treatment has led to an important prolongation of patient survival and life expectancy. The principal international scientific societies of oncology now therefore recommend that long-term survivors of lymphoma join fertility programs. Specifically, fertile-age patients should be assisted by a multidisciplinary team, including specialists dedicated to fertility preservation in oncology, in order to support the completion of their reproductive project. In the general population, the use of Myo-Inositol and D-Chiro-Inositol (MI/DCI) has been demonstrated to be an effective choice to treat ovarian dysfunctions, with a consequent improvement in reproductive outcomes, so it may represent an adjuvant strategy for this purpose. We therefore conducted a pilot prospective case–control study to evaluate the potentialities of this nutritional supplement, with the aim of optimizing reproductive function in female long-term survivors of lymphoma. One group underwent oral supplementation with MI 1200 mg and DCI 135 mg per day for 12 months, compared with controls who underwent no treatment in the same period. After 12 months, FSH, LH, and progesterone levels, as well as oligomenorrhea and antral follicle count (AFC), were significantly improved in the MI/DCI group. In addition, a significantly higher mean value in FSH and LH and a significantly lower mean AFC value in the right ovary were observed in controls compared to the MI/DCI group. Despite the need for further investigation, MI/DCI could be considered a potential adjuvant strategy to restore ovarian function in female long-term survivors of lymphoma.",

    "Title": "Dermatopathology of Malignant Melanoma in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: A Single Institutional Experience",
    "Abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in medicine could support diagnostic and prognostic analyses and decision making. In the field of dermatopathology, there have been various papers that have trained algorithms for the recognition of different types of skin lesions, such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), seborrheic keratosis (SK) and dermal nevus. Furthermore, the difficulty in diagnosing particular melanocytic lesions, such as Spitz nevi and melanoma, considering the grade of interobserver variability among dermatopathologists, has led to an objective difficulty in training machine learning (ML) algorithms to a totally reliable, reportable and repeatable level. In this work we tried to train a fast random forest (FRF) algorithm, typically used for the classification of clusters of pixels in images, to highlight anomalous areas classified as melanoma “defects” following the Allen–Spitz criteria. The adopted image vision diagnostic protocol was structured in the following steps: image acquisition by selecting the best zoom level of the microscope; preliminary selection of an image with a good resolution; preliminary identification of macro-areas of defect in each preselected image; identification of a class of a defect in the selected macro-area; training of the supervised machine learning FRF algorithm by selecting the micro-defect in the macro-area; execution of the FRF algorithm to find an image vision performance indicator; and analysis of the output images by enhancing lesion defects. The precision achieved by the FRF algorithm proved to be appropriate with a discordance of 17% with respect to the dermatopathologist, allowing this type of supervised algorithm to be nominated as a help to the dermatopathologist in the challenging diagnosis of malignant melanoma.",

    "Title": "SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines and Adverse Effects in Gynecology and Obstetrics: The First Italian Retrospective Study",
    "Abstract": "The most common effects reported by the Italian Medicine Agency following administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are myalgia, soreness to the arm of inoculation, fever, and asthenia. To date, there are no specific and official reports registered by the Italian Medicine Agency on possible alterations of the menstrual cycle, or of the female reproductive system, following the vaccine. Actually, clinical experience showed a spread of transient adverse drug reactions of the menstrual cycle, following the administration of all COVID-19 vaccine types, both mRNA and Adenovirus vectored ones. In this work, we conducted the first retrospective study on Italian patients vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 in the period between April 2021 and April 2022, to report the onset of menstrual changes after the vaccine in order to understand: etiology, duration of possible adverse effects, and the extent of the phenomenon. We recruited 100 women aged 18–45, vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2, who were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of 12 multiple choice questions about the effects of the vaccine on the reproductive system. Thirty-seven of them received three doses of the vaccine, while the remaining 63 received two doses. Symptoms such as delayed menstruation and abnormal uterine bleeding (metrorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and menorrhagia) were generally reported within the first three weeks of vaccination, especially after the second dose, with a percentage of 23% and 77%, respectively. These preliminary data suggest that this problem may be broader and deserving of further investigation in the future.",

When mosaic Turner syndrome (TS) occurs with a Y chromosome, there may be ambiguous genitalia. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited neuromuscular disease with an X-Linked recessive pattern of inheritance that predominantly affects males, while females are usually asymptomatic. DMD has also been observed in groups of females affected by TS, not homozygous for the mutation. Here, we report a case of an Indian neonate born with ambiguous genitalia diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound who had a karyotype of 45,X/46,XY and who also had Duchenne muscular dystrophy caused by a de novo mutation in the DMD gene. Physical examination was normal without the typical dysmorphic features of TS with the exception of the genitourinary system showing ambiguous genitalia. Gender was assigned as female. At the age of three years, she had increasing difficulty walking, running, jumping and climbing stairs, proximal upper and lower extremity muscle weakness and a positive Gowers’ sign. In addition, the serum creatine kinase (CK) value was over 30X the upper limit of normal. This study shows that DMD can occur in females with TS having 45,X/46,XY mosaicism and that this coexistence should be considered in women affected by TS who start to develop potential typical symptoms such as motor or developmental delay.",

    "Title": "SARS-CoV-2 and Skin: New Insights and Perspectives",
    "Abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has disrupted global health systems and brought the entire globe to its knees. Although born as a disease of the respiratory system, COVID-19 can affect different parts of the body, including the skin. Reports of ongoing skin manifestations of COVID-19 have gradually multiplied, pushing researchers to investigate the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying these phenomena in more depth. In an attempt to investigate the possible association between SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, TMPRSS2 and skin manifestations, we performed immunohistochemical investigations of the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 in nine skin samples from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared to a cohort of healthy controls. Furthermore, after consulting public databases regarding ACE2 mRNA expression in various cell populations resident in the skin, we conducted a literature review aimed at outlining the current state of this topic. We did not find statistically different immuno-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between the group of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (nine skin biopsies) and the control group. Regarding ACE2, major immunolabeling was present in the epidermal keratinocytes and, rarely, in the fibroblasts and in the adenomeres of the eccrine sweat glands. Regarding the immune expression of TMPRSS2, we found no significant differences between the two groups, with a weak immune staining only in some skin cytotypes. From the review of the literature, we isolated 35 relevant articles according to the inclusion criteria adopted. ACE2 appears to be a target of SARS-CoV-2, although, other receptor molecules may potentially be implicated, such as TMPRSS2. Future studies with large cases and different molecular investigative methods are needed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the skin manifestations of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "Abstract": "(1) Background: Uterine rupture during pregnancy is a serious obstetric complication with a high incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality. (2) Methods: The present case is a rare event of a uterine rupture occurring in an unscarred uterus in a nonlaboring primigravida woman in the second trimester. The only risk factor in this case was adenomyosis found in the preconceptional phase. (3) Results: The diagnosis of adenomyosis can often be difficult, so patients should be evaluated by a specialized gynecologist. After careful amnestic collection, a gynecological examination and II level ultrasound should be performed in accordance with the Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment classification. (4) Conclusions: This evaluation allows us to identify classes of patients at high risk of uterine rupture who, therefore, must be properly informed of the risks both during preconceptional counseling and during pregnancy.",

    "Title": "Circulating Irisin Levels in Patients with Chronic Plaque Psoriasis",
    "Abstract": "Irisin is an adipo-myokine, mainly synthetized in skeletal muscles and adipose tissues, that is involved in multiple processes. Only a few studies have evaluated serum irisin in psoriatic patients. This study aims to analyze serum irisin levels in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, to compare them with values in controls, and to assess whether concentration of circulating irisin correlates with the severity of psoriasis, calculated by means of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). We enrolled 46 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis; the control group included 46 sex- and age-matched subjects without any skin or systemic diseases. Serum irisin levels were measured by competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Our results showed a non-significant increase in serum irisin concentration in psoriatic patients compared to controls. A negative non-linear correlation between PASI and irisin levels was detected in psoriatic patients. Indeed, dividing patients according to psoriasis severity, the negative association between irisin and PASI was stronger in patients with mild psoriasis than in patients with higher PASI scores. Several control variables we tested showed no significant impact on serum irisin. However, erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the normal range was associated with significantly higher irisin levels in psoriatic patients. In conclusion, although irisin levels were not significantly different between controls and psoriatic patients, irisin was found to be negatively associated with psoriasis severity, especially in subjects with low PASI scores; however, further studies are needed to clarify the role of irisin in subjects with psoriasis.",

    "Title": "Molecular Features and Diagnostic Challenges in Alpha/Beta T-Cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia",
    "Abstract": "Large granular lymphocyte leukemia is a rare chronic lymphoproliferative disease of cytotoxic lymphocytes. The diagnosis, according to the WHO, is based on a persistent (>6 months) increase in the number of LGL cells in the peripheral blood without an identifiable cause. A further distinction is made between T-LGL and NK-LGL leukemia. The molecular sign of LGL leukemia is the mutation of STAT3 and other genes associated with the JAK/STAT pathway. The most common clinical features are neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and it is often associated with various autoimmune conditions. It usually has an indolent course. Due to the rarity of the disease, no specific treatment has yet been identified. Immunosuppressive therapy is used and may allow for disease control and long-term survival, but not eradication of the leukemic clone. Here, we discuss the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, pathophysiology, and different treatment options available for alpha/beta T-LGL leukemia, which is the most common disease (85%), in order to better understand and manage this often misunderstood disease.",

    "Title": "Cardiovascular Risk in Patients With Takayasu Arteritis Directly Correlates With Diastolic Dysfunction and Inflammatory Cell Infiltration in the Vessel Wall: A Clinical, ex vivo and in vitro Analysis",
    "Abstract": "Background: Takayasu Arteritis (TAK) increases vascular stiffness and arterial resistance. Atherosclerosis leads to similar changes. We investigated possible differences in cardiovascular remodeling between these diseases and whether the differences are correlated with immune cell expression. Methods: Patients with active TAK arteritis were compared with age- and sex-matched atherosclerotic patients (Controls). In a subpopulation of TAK patients, Treg/Th17 cells were measured before (T0) and after 18 months (T18) of infliximab treatment. Echocardiogram, supraaortic Doppler ultrasound, and lymphocytogram were performed in all patients. Histological and immunohistochemical changes of the vessel wall were evaluated as well. Results: TAK patients have increased aortic valve dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction. The degree of dysfunction appears associated with uric acid levels. A significant increase in aortic stiffness was also observed and associated with levels of peripheral T lymphocytes. CD3+ CD4+ cell infiltrates were detected in the vessel wall samples of TAK patients, whose mean percentage of Tregs was lower than Controls at T0, but increased significantly at T18. Opposite behavior was observed for Th17 cells. Finally, TAK patients were found to have an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Conclusion: Our data suggest that different pathogenic mechanisms underlie vessel damage, including atherosclerosis, in TAK patients compared with Controls. The increased risk of ASCVD in TAK patients correlates directly with the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration in the vessel wall. Infliximab restores the normal frequency of Tregs/Th17 in TAK patients and allows a possible reduction of steroids and immunosuppressants.",

    "Abstract": "Perivascular epithelioid cell tumours (PEComas) are a growing family of tumours composed of histologically and immunohistochemically distinctive perivascular epithelioid cells. Cutaneous primitive PEComas (cPEComas) are very rare, with 65 cases described in the English literature, and occur as a painless lesion predominantly in female patients, with a wide age range. We present a new case of cPEComa found on the left thigh of a 53-year-old patient with histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular information. The lesion was positive for HMB-45 and focal for smooth muscle actin and desmin but negative for melan-A, S-100 protein, CD31, and CD34. Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis demonstrated the presence of genomic aberration for baculoviral IAP repeats containing BIRC3 splice site 1622-27_1631del37. Although there are little molecular data regarding this entity, our case adds to this knowledge, considering the importance of detecting genomic aberrations in the context of specific therapies such as mTOR inhibitors.",

    "Title": "Development of anti-somatostatin receptors CAR T cells for treatment of neuroendocrine tumors",
    "Abstract": "Background Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) overexpress somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Methods We developed a second-generation, ligand-based, anti-SSTR chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) incorporating the somatostatin analog octreotide in its extracellular moiety. Results Anti-SSTR CAR T cells exerted antitumor activity against SSTR+NET cell linesin vitro. The killing activity was highly specific, as demonstrated by the lack of CAR T cell reactivity against NET cells engineered to express mutated variants of SSTR2/5 by CRISPR/Cas9. When adoptively transferred in NSG mice, anti-SSTR CAR T cells induced significant antitumor activity against human NET xenografts. Although anti-SSTR CAR T cells could recognize the murine SSTRs as shown by their killing ability against murine NET cells, no obvious deleterious effects on SSTR-expressing organs such as the brain or the pancreas were observed in mice. Conclusions Taken together, our results establish anti-SSTR CAR T cells as a potential candidate for early phase clinical investigations in patients with NETs. More broadly, the demonstration that a known peptide drug can direct CAR T cell targeting may streamline the potential utility of multiple peptide motifs and provide a blueprint for therapeutic applications in a variety of cancers.",

    "Abstract": "(1) Background: As the pandemic months progress, more and more evidence shows that the placenta acts as a “barrier” to SARS-CoV-2, although rare cases of vertical transmission have been described. (2) Methods: In an attempt to investigate whether the symptoms’ severity was related to different placental histological characteristics and the immune microenvironment, we subdivided 29 placentas from 29 mothers positive for SARS-CoV-2 into two groups, depending on the symptomatology (moderate/severe vs. asymptomatic/mild), performing immunohistochemical investigations for CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, as well as for CD68 + macrophage. We also evaluated the immuno-expression of the ACE2 receptor at the placental level. These two groups were compared to a control group of 28 placentas from 28 SARS-CoV-2-negative healthy mothers. (3) Results: The symptoms (likely to be related to viremia) were statistically significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with histopathological changes, such as maternal malperfusion, decidual arteriopathy, blood vessel thrombus of fetal relevance. Furthermore, the immuno-expression of ACE2 was significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2-positive groups vs. control group (p = 0.001).

    "Title": "Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Arising in Patients with Preexisting Hodgkin Lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "The metachronic onset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a rare event affecting patients’ outcomes. However, although several studies have investigated the prognostic role of this event, little is known about a hypothetical common origin of the two different neoplastic cells. Aims: To investigate a possible relationship between DLBCL and cHL, in this retrospective study of 269 patients with newly diagnosed cHL treated at Bari University Hospital (Italy) between 2007 and 2020, we analyzed data from 4 patients (3 male and 1 female) with cHL who subsequently developed DLBCL. Methods: Gene expression profile analysis, assessed by NanoString Lymphoma Subtype Assay, was performed to identify the cell of origin in the DLBCL cases, in addition to Hans’s algorithm. Results: Using Hans’s algorithm, all DLBCL cases showed a germinal center-B-Cell subtype. The gene expression profile evaluated by the NanoString Lymphoma Subtype Assay revealed two cases of the GCB molecular subtype, while the others were unclassified. After first-line chemotherapy, 1 patient achieved complete remission, 3 were non-responders (2 died of lymphoma within 6 months, whereas the other achieved complete remission after autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation and is still alive). Conclusions: The origin of the second neoplastic cell in patients with DLBCL with a previous history of cHL remains controversial, although the different immunophenotypic characteristics suggest that it may mainly arise de novo in a subject with a possible individual predisposition to develop lymphoid neoplasms.",

    "Title": "Clinic, Endoscopic and Histological Features in Patients Treated with ICI Developing GI Toxicity: Some News and Reappraisal from a Mono-Institutional Experience",
    "Abstract": "Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have widened the therapeutic scenario of different solid tumors over the last ten years. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs), such as diarrhea and colitis, occur in up to 50% of patients treated with ICIs. Materials and methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis in patients with solid tumors treated with ICIs in a 6-year period, from 2015 to 2021, developing GI AEs, for which an endoscopic analysis was performed, with available histological specimens or surgery. Results: Twenty-one patients developed GI AEs under ICIs. The median time from the start of ICIs to the onset of GI AEs was 5 months. Diarrhea was the most frequent symptom (57.2%), upper GI symptoms presented in four patients (19%), while three patients (14.3%) had no symptoms and were diagnosed occasionally. Two patients underwent surgical resection for acute abdomen. Histological findings observed in endoscopic sampling were eosinophilic-pattern gastro-enterocolitis, apoptotic damage, IBD-like features, and ischemic-like changes. Histological damage was also documented in patients with unremarkable endoscopy. Conclusions: Under ICI therapy, GI toxicity is an expected event. Since GIAEs can mimic a broad range of primary GI diseases, a multidisciplinary approach is advocated with upper and lower GI mucosal sampling to remodel therapy and avoid complications.",

We conducted a monocentric and cross-sectional study enrolling 122 un-vaccinated pregnant women with COVID-19 infection tested by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab. Only 4.1% of the patients had severe COVID-19 symptoms together with major respiratory symptoms and intensive care unit admission, whereas 35.25% of women had comorbidities and two-thirds of them were overweight or obese. COVID-19 was detected mainly in the third trimester (98.36%) and multiparous women (59.02%). The mode of delivery was influenced by mild–severe COVID-19 symptoms, with a higher number of urgent or emergent cesarean sections than spontaneous or operative vaginal births. Preterm births were associated with high BMI, mode of delivery (higher among cesarean sections), nulliparity, and severe COVID-19 symptoms. In cases of severe COVID-19 symptoms, there was a higher rate of respiratory distress syndrome among newborns. In the end, only the presence of a severe COVID-19 infection worsened the obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, with higher rates of urgent or emergent cesarean section, preterm births, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.",

    "Title": "The Effect of the Tumor Microenvironment on Lymphoid Neoplasms Derived from B Cells",
    "Abstract": "Lymphomas are characteristic tumors surrounded by an inflammatory microenvironment. The cells of the microenvironment are essential for the growth and survival of neoplastic cells and are recruited through the effect of cytokines/chemokines. Lymphomas include heterogeneous groups of neoplasms infiltrating various lymphoid structures which may arise from B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells at various stages of their differentiation state. In this review article, we analyze the literature data concerning the involvement of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the progression of lymphomas and the recent advances in the analysis of microenvironment components in the most common forms: some mature B cell lymphoma neoplasms and classic Hodgkin lymphomas. The complex crosstalk between the TME and tumor cells led to the discovery of many mechanisms usable as molecular-targeted therapy through the control of diverse elements of the TME, varying from inhibitors of angiogenic cytokines and their receptors to the regulation of cells’ activities and the novel immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "Title": "Immune Disregulation in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Patients with Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa: A Single Pilot Study",
    "Abstract": "Background: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most devastating complications of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). We recently demonstrated a reduction in immune cell peritumoral infiltration in RDEB patients with cSCC, together with a reduction in CD3+, CD4+, CD68+ and CD20 lymphocytes as compared to primary and secondary cSCC in patients without RDEB. Recently, new molecules, such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), T cell immunoglobulin, mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) and Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), have been shown to play a role in antitumoral immunity. Objective: Patients with RDEB are known to be at increased risk of developing skin cancers, including the dreaded squamous cell carcinoma of the. Tendentially, cSCCs that arise in the context of EBDR are more aggressive and lead to statistically significant bad outcomes compared to cSCCs developed on the skin of patients without EBDR. In an attempt to study the microenvironment of these lesions, we conducted an immunohistochemical analysis study of proteins that could be actively involved in the genesis of this type of malignant neoplasms. Methods: In this retrospective study, the OH1-HMGB1-TIM3 activation axis, as correlated to the T lymphocytes cell count, was assessed in biopsy samples from 31 consecutive cases consisting of 12 RDEB patients with cSCC, 12 patients with primary cSCC and 7 RDEB patients with pseudoepitheliomatous cutaneous hyperplasia. Parametric Student’s t-test was applied for normally distributed values, such as CD4+ and CD8+, and non-parametric Mann–Whitney test for non-normally distributed values, such as HMGB-1, TIM-3 and HO-1. Results: In RDEB patients with cSCC and with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, the expression of CD4 T helper lymphocytes was lower than in the peritumoral infiltrate found in primary cSCC. CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes were increased in primary cSCC compared to the other two groups. An increased HMGB1 expression was evident in both primary and RDEB cSCC. TIM3 expression was higher in RDEB patients with cSCC compared to the other two groups. A significantly reduced immunohistochemical expression of HO-1 was evident in the tumoral microenvironment of cSCC-RDEB as compared to primary cSCC. Conclusions: These data suggest that a reduced immune cell peritumoral infiltration in RDEB patients could be responsible, in the complexity of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and host response, of the particular aggressiveness of the cSCC of RDEB patients, creating a substrate for greater local immunosuppression, which, potentially, can “open the doors” to development and eventual metastasis by this malignant neoplasm.",

Many variants of dermatofibromas have been described and knowledge of these variations is important to avoid a misdiagnosis of a possibly more aggressive tumour. Histological features of different variants can coexist in the same lesion, but typical common fibrous histiocytoma features are generally found, at least focally, in all cases. However, when cellular changes make up the majority of the lesion, the histopathological diagnosis can become more complex and requires immunohistochemical investigations for a correct nosographic classification.

    "Title": "A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Skin Lesion Segmentation and Classification",
    "Abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most common diseases that can be initially detected by visual observation and further with the help of dermoscopic analysis and other tests. As at an initial stage, visual observation gives the opportunity of utilizing artificial intelligence to intercept the different skin images, so several skin lesion classification methods using deep learning based on convolution neural network (CNN) and annotated skin photos exhibit improved results. In this respect, the paper presents a reliable approach for diagnosing skin cancer utilizing dermoscopy images in order to improve health care professionals' visual perception and diagnostic abilities to discriminate benign from malignant lesions. The swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms were used for skin lesion region of interest (RoI) segmentation from dermoscopy images, and the speeded-up robust features (SURF) was used for feature extraction of the RoI marked as the best segmentation result obtained using the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA). The skin lesions are classified into two groups using CNN against three data sets, namely, ISIC-2017, ISIC-2018, and PH-2 data sets. The proposed segmentation and classification techniques' results are assessed in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, precision, MCC, dice coefficient, and Jaccard index, with an average classification accuracy of 98.42 percent, precision of 97.73 percent, and MCC of 0.9704 percent.

The standard addition and second-order derivative methods were selected for the ongoing research work to eliminate the possible effect of interferences in a real environment. In this work, Ag-NPs were prepared by reducing silver nitrate salt in the presence of 1,3-di-(1H-imidazole-1-yl) −2-propanol (DIPO) in an aqueous medium. Urea in the urine samples was successfully determined through the complexation of Ag-NPs with urea molecules. The results revealed high percent recovery with ± RSD of urea in the three different urine samples, where percent recoveries by spectrofluorometric standard addition were 99.77 ± 3.4, 100.24 ± 5.1, 100.93 ± 2.8 and that is by the spectrofluorometric second-order derivative method were 103.57 ± 2.4, 101.8 ± 1.3, 98 ± 3.2, respectively. The successful application of these analytical methods in the spectrofluorometric determination of urea in urine samples can accumulate further addition in the effects and possible role of Ag-NPs in the determination of biological molecules in biological and non-biological samples in the scientific as well as clinical fields.",

    "Title": "Preoperative sonographic assessment of a leiomyoma of the round ligament",
    "Abstract": "We report a case of leiomyoma of the round ligament in a 59-year-old woman, with suspicion of ovarian cancer during gynaecological routine examination. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous solid pelvic mass in the left adnexal area but during the evaluation of its anatomical relation, both ovaries appeared to be regular and the neoformation was separated from the uterus. Surgical and pathological examination revealed well-defined solid mass arising from the left round ligament of the uterus identified as leiomyoma with myxoid degeneration. Leiomyomas of the Round Ligament of the uterus are very rare tumors and they may arise as inguinal, pelvic or vulvar masses miming an inguinal hernia, a lymphadenopathy or a solid adnexal mass. The preoperative sonographic assessment is essential to perform a correct differential diagnosis and provide a right management of the case.",

    "Abstract": "Human skeletal remains are considered as real biological archives of each subject’s life. Generally, traumas, wounds, surgical interventions, and many human pathologies suffered in life leave identifiable marks on the skeleton, and their correct interpretation is possible only through a meticulous anthropological investigation of skeletal remains. The study here presented concerns the analysis of a young Slavic soldier’s skeleton who died, after his imprisonment, in the concentration camp of Torre Tresca (Bari, Italy), during the Second World War (1946). In particular, the skull exhibited signs of surgical activity on the posterior cranial fossa and the parieto-occipital bones. They could be attributed to surgical procedures performed at different times, showing various degrees of bone edge remodeling. Overall, it was possible to correlate the surgical outcomes highlighted on the skull to the Torkildsen’s ventriculocisternostomy (VCS), the first clinically successful shunt for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion in hydrocephalus, which gained widespread use in the 1940s. For this reason, the skeleton we examined represents a rare, precious, and historical testimony of an emerging and revolutionary neurosurgical technique, which differed from other operations for treating hydrocephalus before the Second World War and was internationally recognized as an efficient procedure before the introduction of extracranial shunts.",

    "Title": "Sonophotocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant under visible light over Pt decorated CeO<sub>2</sub>: Role of ultrasonic waves for unprecedented degradation",
    "Abstract": "Sonophotocatalysis is an innovative energy transfer technique proposed to produce solar energy and environmental remediation. Herein, we designed platinum (Pt) decorated CeO2 and applied it as sonophotocatalyst for pollutant degradation. Sonophotocatalytic activity of the as-prepared Pt/CeO2 nanocomposite was carried out at 40 kHz frequency ultrasonic waves under visible light irradiation. The sonophotocatalytic degradation efficiency of Acid Red 17 over Pt/CeO2 nanocomposite is much higher when compared to photocatalytic degradation. This unprecedented sonophotoactivity is credited to ultrasonic waves that generate additional OH• free radicals by scavengers test. The effect of various operational conditions like pH, amount of catalyst, and concentration of acid red 17 dye were also studied. More intriguingly, the sonophotoactivity of the optimized amount remains high and almost unchanged for up to four cycles, indicating the stability of the sonophotocatalyst. This steady progress has exemplified that Pt/CeO2 nanocomposites are playing and will continue to play an indispensable role in solar energy production and environmental remediation.",

    "Title": "A rare case of posterior fossa tumor and central precocious puberty: Case presentation and review of the literature",
    "Abstract": "Central precocious puberty (CPP) is a condition that causes early gonadotropin-dependent sexual development; CPP is idiopathic in girls in most cases, whereas more than 50% of boys have an identifiable etiology. We conducted a qualitative systematic review following the ENTREQ (enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research) framework. A search was made in MEDLINE/Pubmed and MeSH Database using the terms “precocious puberty” AND “brain tumor” OR “posterior fossa tumor” OR “cerebellar tumor” OR “infratentorial tumor”, iden-tifying five cases of pediatric patients with infratentorial tumors and CPP and a case of cerebellar ganglioglioma without hypothalamic−pituitary−gonadal axis involvement and/or intracranial hypertension. Our work highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and extensive central nervous system imaging for patients presenting with CPP in order to detect possible tumor association. Moreover, we believe that this manuscript could contribute to stimulate other research because the exact mechanism of CPP in infratentorial brain lesions has not been understood yet.",

The recognition of tools for proper screening, early diagnosis, and prognosis of OC is still lagging. The application of methods such as radiomics to medical images such as ultrasound scan (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) in OC may help to realize so-called “precision medicine” by developing new quantification metrics linking qualitative and/or quantitative data imaging to achieve clinical diagnostic endpoints. This narrative review aims to summarize the applications of radiomics as a support in the management of a complex pathology such as ovarian cancer.

    "Title": "Cutaneous metastasis from colorectal cancer: Making light on an unusual and misdiagnosed event",
    "Abstract": "Cutaneous metastasis from solid tumors is a rare event and usually represents a late occurrence in the natural history of an advanced visceral malignancy. Rarely, cutaneous metastasis has been described in colorectal cancer patients. The most frequent cutaneous site of colorectal metastasis is the surgical scar in the abdomen following the removal of the primary malignancy, followed by the extremities, perineum, head, neck, and penis. Metastases to the thigh and back of the trunk are anecdotical. Dermatological diagnosis of cutaneous metastasis can be quite complex, especially in unusual sites, such as in the facial skin or thorax and in cases of single cutaneous lesions since metastasis from colorectal cancer is not usually the first clinical hypothesis, leading to misdiagnosis. To date, due to the rarity of cutaneous metastasis from colorectal cancer, little evidence, most of which is based on case reports and very small case series, is currently available. Therefore, a better understanding of the clinic-pathological characteristics of this unusual metastatic site represents an unmet clinical need. We present a large series of 29 cutaneous metastases from colorectal cancer with particular concerns regarding anatomic localization and the time of onset with respect to primitive colorectal cancer and visceral metastases.",

    "Title": "Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Thigh as Unusual Colonoscopic Polypectomy Complication: Review of the Literature with Case Presentation",
    "Abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is an infection characterized by necrosis of the superficial muscle fascia and surrounding soft tissues. It usually occurs following skin breaches from penetrating traumas or high-degree burns. Less frequently, it could be related to major abdominal surgery. However, no cases of thigh NF after minor abdominal procedures have ever been reported. A previously healthy 59-year-old male patient underwent a colonoscopic polypectomy. After the procedure, the patient developed an increasing right groin pain. The CT scan showed a gas collection in the right retroperitoneum space and in the right thigh soft tissues. Thus, a right colon perforation was hypothesized, and the patient was moved to the nearest surgery department and underwent a right hemicolectomy procedure. During surgery, the right thigh was also incised and drained, with gas and pus leakage. Nevertheless, the right lower limb continued to swell, and signs of systemic infection appeared. Afterward, clinical conditions continued to worsen despite the drainage of the thigh and antibiotic therapy, and the patient died of septic shock after just two days. This case shows that, although rare, lower limb NF should be considered among the causes of early post-operative local painful symptoms.",

    "Abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has completely disrupted the health systems of the entire planet. From the earliest months, it became increasingly clear that in addition to affecting the upper airways and lungs, there were other organs that could be affected. Among these, the skin became a real “sentinel signal” to be able to even suspect COVID-19. Background: this study deals with a little-explored issue for now: the study of skin immunopathology in SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects ascertained using the most reliable methods available. Methods: we used skin biopsy samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients, studying morphology (Hematoxylin-Eosin), T lymphocyte population (CD4 and CD8), three markers such as HMGB-1, TIM-3 and HO-1 by immunohistochemistry. Results: although the presence of the CD4 and CD8 T population did not differ statistically significantly, we found greater activation and release of HMGB-1 in skin samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, greater immunolabeling for TIM-3 at the level of CD4 and CD8 and a reduced expression of Heme oxygenase 1. Conclusions: these results support the possibility that there is immune deregulation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who develop skin manifestations of various kinds.",

    "Title": "Death related to a congenital vascular anomaly of pulmonary hamartoma type: Malpractice or tragic fatality?",
    "Abstract": "In forensic pathology, apparently straightforward cases can often hide rarities that, if not correctly interpreted, can alter the results of the entire investigation, leading to misinterpretations. This occurs when the investigation is conducted to assess medical malpractice. An unexpected death, with no known apparent cause, is often linked to an underlying disease process of unclear etiological origin whose nature can, unfortunately, be properly investigated only post-mortem. This presentation shows a case study, in which it was possible to reconduct the death of a patient to a natural pathology and not to medical treatment. Here, the authors illustrate a case with a hamartoma developed in chronic inflammatory conditions (bronchiectasis) that was difficult to differentiate from lung cancer due to the inability to perform specific instrumental examinations. The hamartoma, usually benign and identifiable by standard instrumental investigations, in this case, led to the patient’s death precisely during the execution of a bronchoscopy. However, in the absence of a certain cause of death, public opinion unanimously attributes a patient’s disease to medical error. Indeed, a routine practice such as bronchoscopy should not cause death and consequently, the doctor must have made a mistake. Fortunately, the autopsy not only demonstrated the origin of the bleeding but also unveiled the reason for this, as rare congenital lung disease. Fate, one might say.",

Although it is now clear that SARS-CoV-2 can affect various different organs, including the lungs, brain, skin, vessels, placenta and others, less is yet known about adverse reactions from vaccines, although more and more reports are starting to emerge. Among the adverse events, we focused particularly on skin rashes. In this short report, we describe the case of a patient vaccinated with Comirnaty, who developed a purpuric rash resistant to oral steroid therapy after 2 weeks. To date, this is one of the very few cases in which skin biopsy was performed to better characterize the histopathological picture of this rash. Finally, we conduct a literature review of the cases of rashes from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines described in the literature, with the aim of laying foundations for future, larger case studies.",

The diagnosis of TBP can be easily mistaken for advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) or peritoneal carcinoma because of overlapping laboratory and clinical findings. We reported the ultrasound characteristics of a case of TBP in a 67-year-old woman who presented to our institute with a 1-month history of intermittent lower abdominal pain, fever, and asthenia. Overall, 20 biopsy-retrieved specimen histopathological features were suggestive of peritoneal tuberculosis. Gynecologic ultrasound revealed increased adnexa with multiple nodular formations spread across the surface, suggestive of caseous nodules. Although this is a rare occurrence, clinicians should consider TBP as a differential diagnosis of ovarian or peritoneal cancer.",

    "Title": "Mesonephric-like carcinosarcoma of the ovary associated with low-grade serous carcinoma: A case report",
    "Abstract": "Mesonephric adenocarcinomas are rare tumors of the female genital tract, thought to arise from embryonic mesonephric remnants, primarily in the cervix and vagina. Conversely, endometrial and ovarian mesonephric adenocarcinomas may have a different pathogenesis, probably originating from transdifferentiated Müllerian carcinomas, as demonstrated by the association of these neoplasms with endometriosis and ovarian serous tumors. For this reason, in the endometrium and in the ovary, they are defined as “mesonephric-like adenocarcinomas”. Some cases of mesonephric carcinomas of the female genital tract have been reported to show a sarcomatous component and have been defined as “mesonephric carcinosarcomas”, characterized by poor prognosis and high metastatic behavior, but this entity has never been described in the ovary. The case herein presented is of a 74-year-old female with abdominal discomfort and a complex ovarian mass. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis showed features of ovarian mesonephric-like carcinoma combined with a low-grade serous component, in support of the theory of a Müllerian origin of these neoplasms. The tumor also revealed foci of chondrosarcomatous differentiation, never before reported in the ovary, showing a similar immunohistochemical profile to the mesonephric-like elements. This work thus describes the first reported case of ovarian mesonephric-like carcinosarcoma.",

    "Abstract": "A mass disaster is a situation that involves criticality between the number of victims and resources, in terms of both men and means, present on the site of an event that is mostly unexpected and sudden. In the multidisciplinary teams that intervene, the role of forensic pathologists, who are responsible for the direction and coordination of post-mortem operations, is central, and must remain so. The authors report the case of an explosion of a pyrotechnic artifice factory, as a result of which numerous victims and injuries are recorded. So, the team completed the autopsies and created a protocol to obtain biological samples (bones, blood, teeth, muscles), while the forensic pathologists contacted the families of the alleged victims and each provided a blood sample that was collected for the DNA. The geneticist, using the method of gene extraction and amplification, obtained the DNA from each bone, tooth, and muscle of blood taken from the victims and then compared it with that extracted from the blood samples of the relatives; the electropherograms showed at least one allele for each genetic marker of the “Combined DNA Index System” in common between the victims and the families, thus allowing to establish the identity of all the subjects involved in the event. Having established the identity of all workers, it was possible to determine their whereabouts in the environment at the time of the location of fires and explosions. The results of the various forensic analyzes (autopsies, genetic investigations and even traumatological investigations) have allowed us to validate a scientific method useful in all mass disasters even when any type of anthropological or forensic dental research is difficult.",

    "Abstract": "The study of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women is of some importance for gynecolo-gists, obstetricians, neonatologists and women themselves. In recent months, new works have tried to clarify what happens at the fetal–placental level in women positive for the virus, and different pathogenesis mechanisms have been proposed. Here, we present the results of a large series of placentas of Coronavirus disease (COVID) positive women, in a reference center for COVID-positive pregnancies, on which we conducted histological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopy investigations. A case–control study was conducted in order to highlight any histopathological alterations attributable to SARS-CoV-2. The prevalence of maternal vascular malperfusion was not significantly different between cases and controls (54.3% vs. 43.7% p = 0.19), whereas the differences with regard to fetal vascular malperfusion (21.1% vs. 4.2% p < 0.001) were significant. More frequent in cases with respect to controls were decidual arteriopathy (40.9% vs. 1.4% p < 0.0001), decidual inflammation (32.4% vs. 0.7% p < 0.0001), perivillous fibrin deposition (36.6% vs. 3.5% p < 0.0001) and fetal vessel thrombi (22.5% vs. 0.7% p < 0.0001). No significant differences in the percentage of terminal villous hyperplasia and chorioamnionitis were observed between the two groups. As the pandemic continues, these studies will become more urgent in order to clarify the possible mechanism of maternal–fetal transmission of the virus.",

    "Title": "A convolutional neural network with transfer learning for automatic discrimination between low and high-grade synovitis: a pilot study",
    "Abstract": "Ultrasound-guided synovial tissue biopsy (USSB) may allow personalizing the treatment for patients with inflammatory arthritis. To this end, the quantification of tissue inflammation in synovial specimens can be crucial to adopt proper therapeutic strategies. This study aimed at investigating whether computer vision may be of aid in discriminating the grade of synovitis in patients undergoing USSB. We used a database of 150 photomicrographs of synovium from patients who underwent USSB. For each hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slide, Krenn’s score was calculated. After proper data pre-processing and fine-tuning, transfer learning on a ResNet34 convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to discriminate between low and high-grade synovitis (Krenn’s score < 5 or ≥ 5). We computed test phase metrics, accuracy, precision (true positive/actual results), and recall (true positive/predicted results). The Grad-Cam algorithm was used to highlight the regions in the image used by the model for prediction. We analyzed photomicrographs of specimens from 12 patients with arthritis. The training dataset included n.90 images (n.42 with high-grade synovitis). Validation and test datasets included n.30 (n.14 high-grade synovitis) and n.30 items (n.16 with high-grade synovitis). An accuracy of 100% (precision = 1, recall = 1) was scored in the test phase. Cellularity in the synovial lining and sublining layers was the salient determinant of CNN prediction. This study provides a proof of concept that computer vision with transfer learning is suitable for scoring synovitis. Integrating CNN-based approach into real-life patient management may improve the workflow between rheumatologists and pathologists.",

Less than three months later, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) to be a global pandemic. Growing numbers of clinical, histopathological, and molecular findings were subsequently reported, among which a particular interest in skin manifestations during the course of the disease was evinced. Today, about one year after the development of the first major infectious foci in Italy, various large case series of patients with COVID-19-related skin manifestations have focused on skin specimens. However, few are supported by histopathological, immunohistochemical, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data on skin specimens. Here, we present nine cases of COVID-positive patients, confirmed by histological, immunophenotypical, and PCR findings, who underwent skin biopsy. A review of the literature in Italian cases with COVID-related skin manifestations is then provided.",

To analyze a human's most fundamental behavior, we must examine these feelings using emotional data, also known as affect data. Text, voice, and other types of data can be used. Affective Computing, which uses this emotional data to analyze emotions, is a scientific fields. Emotion computation is a difficult task; significant progress has been made, but there is still scope for improvement. With the introduction of social networking sites, it is now possible to connect with people from all over the world. Many people are attracted to examining the text available on these various social websites. Analyzing this data through the Internet means we're exploring the entire continent, taking in all of the communities and cultures along the way. This paper analyze text emotion of Iraqi people about COVID-19 using data collected from twitter, People's opinions can be classified based on lexicon into different separate classifications of feelings (anticipation, anger, trust, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust, and joy) as well as two distinct emotions (positive and negative), which can then be visualized using charts to find the most prevalent emotion using lexicon-based analysis",

    "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with various clinical manifestations, including skin lesions. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down period numerous chilblain-like lesions, mainly located on the feet, were observed in adolescents. The latter were often asymptomatic or associated with very mild respiratory symptoms. Here, we report three cases of acral nodular lesions in SARS-CoV-2 swab-negative adolescents with histological findings of chronic immune-mediated inflammation and immunohistochemical evidence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins in endothelial cells and eccrine sweat glands. In one of these cases, the virus presence was confirmed by electron microscopy. Copyright:",

    "Abstract": "Pilomatrixcarcinoma is a very rare follicular neoplasm that shows matrical differentiation. The majority of these lesions originate de novo, while only a few cases of transformation of pilomatri-coma (calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe) have been described in the literature. The neoplasm affects mostly middle-aged males with a male-to-female ratio of 3–4:1. The most common localizations are the face, head, trunk and extremites, though there are a few reports of pilomatrixcarcinoma of the eyelid, eyebrow, axilla and clitorid. Here, we describe the first case of a pilomatrixcarcinoma on the anterolateral surface of the first toe of the left foot of an 83-year-old patient, which developed in less than six months and led to amputation of the distal phalanx. We report a brief review of the current literature with particular emphasis on histopathological features useful for diagnosis.",

    "Title": "Bilateral phyllodes giant tumor. A case report analyzed by array-CGH",
    "Abstract": "The breast phyllodes tumor is a biphasic tumor that accounts for less than of 1% of all breast neoplasms. It is classified as benign, borderline, or malignant, and can mimic benign masses. Some recurrent alterations have been identified. However, a precise molecular classification of these tumors has not yet been established. Herein, we describe a case of a 43-year-old woman that was admitted to the emergency room for a significant bleeding from the breast skin. A voluminous ulcerative mass of the left breast and multiple nodules with micro-calcifications on the right side were detected at a physical examination. A left total mastectomy and a nodulectomy of the right breast was performed. The histological diagnosis of the surgical specimens reported a bilateral giant phyllodes tumor, showing malignant features on the left and borderline characteristics associated with a fibroadenoma on the right. A further molecular analysis was carried out by an array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to characterize copy-number alterations. Many losses were detected in the malignant mass, involving several tumor suppressor genes. These findings could explain the malignant growth and the metastatic risk. In our study, genomic profiling by an array-CGH revealed a greater chromosomal instability in the borderline mass (40 total defects) than in the malignant (19 total defects) giant phyllodes tumor, reflecting the tumor heterogeneity. Should our results be confirmed with more sensitive and specific molecular tests (DNA sequencing and FISH analysis), they could allow a better selection of patients with adverse pathological features, thus optimizing and improving patient’s management.",

    "Title": "VALUE OF THE MEDICAL-LEGAL INVESTIGATION. CORRESPONDENCE OF THE FINDINGS WITH LEGALLY ESTABLISHED REALITY",
    "Abstract": "In recent years, violence against minors has been the subject of in-depth study in all its historical, social and cultural dimensions, being able to be identified and treated according to rigorous scientific methodologies. The A.A. report the case of an 8-year-old girl, who disappeared in a rural area, found dead a few hours later, on the recommendation of a young man who, despite having admitted to having gone away with the child, had not provided further details. The forensic inspection revealed that the discovery area included an area with burnt undergrowth about 4 meters in diameter. Examination of the external genitalia showed that the hymen was hemorrhagic in the right hemicycle, at 11 o'clock, with laceration of the most superficial layers of the anterior face. In the present case, therefore, despite having limited historical and circumstantial data, it was possible to reconstruct the following damaging dynamic: the little girl, after having gone away with her aggressor, was first the victim of an attempt of sexual violence by the latter and later immobilized by placing a foot on the slender abdomen. She had been covered with brushwood which the attacker had set fire to, thus killing her. This reconstruction of the criminal events, proposed to the investigating magistrate, was confirmed in each passage by the confessions made by the murderer, during the various degrees of trial, so much so that the final sentence reported in full the specific steps of the medico-legal relationship.",

    "Abstract": "Virtually any malignancy can metastasize to the liver. Large solitary metastases are rare and can be difficult to distinguish from primary tumors. Malignant mesothelioma is often considered as a locally invasive cancer but tumor dissemination to extra-thoracic sites is possible, and the liver can be involved. Herein, we present a rare case of pleural mesothelioma with a solitary large liver metastasis diagnosed postmortem in a ninety-two-year-old man with 35 years of exposure to asbestos. Results of immunohistochemical staining of the pleural and liver tumor were similar, both positive for low-molecular weight keratins, calretinin, vimentin, and podoplanin, and negative for Claudin-4, TTF1, CEA, BerEP4, CK7, CK19, CK20, BAP1, Hep Par1, p40, and WT1. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) for p16/CDKN2A was also performed and a homozygous deletion was detected in both tumors, supporting the diagnosis of mesothelioma. Reporting this case, we would like to point out that extra-thoracic dissemination from pleural mesothelioma, even if exceptional, can occur. In cases where differential diagnoses are challenging, the value of ancillary techniques and a practical approach to diagnostic work-up is of primary importance.",

    "Title": "Rare gastrointestinal metastases from primary lung cancer. Two case reports of patients managed with emergency surgery",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer represents the second leading cause of death in US and the high mortality rate could be related to the diagnosis, usually, performed in an advanced metastatic stage. Gastrointestinal metastases from non-small cell lung cancer, are extremely rare and only few cases complicated by digestive haemorrhage and/or perforation have been reported in literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report two cases of gastrointestinal metastases and their rare clinical onset with haemor-rhage and perforation of the digestive tract. Both patients were admitted in an emergency setting. The first case was a 59-year-old man complained of abdominal pain and massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an ulcerated gastric mass and an emergency CT-scans showed a right lung mass with biopsy conclusive for a large cell lung cancer. The second case was a 62-year-old man with abdominal pain and shock due to gastrointestinal bleeding. He was sub-mitted to an emergency CT-scan showing two lung nodules (1.0 and 3.5 cm of diameter) as well as widespread metas-tases, intraperitoneal free air and fluids. RESULTS: Both patients were surgical managed in emergency and pathology revealed the metastatic origin from an unknown large-cell lung cancer and a rare lung adenocarcinoma in the second one. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the rare clinical condition, in patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer managed in emergency for gastrointestinal complication, gastrointestinal metastases should be taken into account, and referred to the primary disease in order to tailor the best approach.",

    "Title": "Multimedia Imaging System of Data Collection and Antenna Alignment for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based Internet of Things",
    "Abstract": "Because network of sensors gives a more accurate representation of remotely sensed environments, a network of wirelessly connected sensors is essential. Data packets must be routed to the base station hop by hop, which causes conventional network data collecting to use a lot of power. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were employed for hovering over the detected environment and gather data to solve this issue. The paper also aims to provide an automatic alignment for UAV antennas for tracking by utilising computer vision technologies. A directional antenna with high gain is used by a ground station that can operate by a pan-tilt to point towards the low-gain omnidirectional antenna carried by the UAV. To center the UAV's antenna's image in the frame, the antenna is equipped with a camera, and a computer detects the video and controls the pan-tilt. The antennas are aligned if there are no more than a few pixels between the UAV image center and the image center. The proposed imaging system exhibits fast data collection, thus attaining a high packet delivery rate and the minimum use of energy. With the suggested antenna auto-alignment approach, the antennas can be accurately aligned with an angle error of under one. UAVs must take the smoothest and shortest pathways possible to accommodate their motion and time constraints. As a result, the Traveling Sales Problem (TSP) is utilized to determine the shortest route, and Bezier curves are then employed to turn paths into a flyable path.",

    "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoTs) has accelerated with the introduction of powerful biomedical sensors, telemedicine services and population ageing are concerns that can be solved by smart healthcare systems. However, the security of medical signal data that collected from sensors of IoTs technology, while it is being transmitted over public channels has grown to be a serious problem that has limited the adoption of intelligent healthcare systems. This suggests using the technology of blockchain to create a safe and reliable heart sound signal (PCG) that can communicate with wireless body area networks. The security plan offers a totally dependable and safe environment for every data flowing from the back end to front-end. Also in this paper, to classify heart sound signals, we suggested a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model. The denoising autoencoder extracted the heart sounds' deep features as an input feature of 1D-CNN. To extract the detailed characteristics from the PCG signals, a Data Denoising Auto Encoder (DDAE) was used instead of the standard MFCC, the suggested model shows significant improvement. The system's benefits include a less difficult encryption algorithm and a more capable and effective blockchain-based data transfer and storage system.",

The expanding sheet, whose function of sheet velocity is nonlinear, confines the Casson nanofluid. The final equations, which are obtained from the first mathematical formulations, are solved using the MATLAB built-in solver bvp4c. Utilizing similarity conversion, ODEs are converted in their ultimate form. A number of graphs and tabulations are also provided to show the effects of important flow parameters on the results distribution. Slip parameter was shown to increase fluid temperature and decrease entropy formation. On the production of entropy, the Brinkman number and concentration gradient have opposing effects. In the presence of nanoparticles, the Eckert number effect's augmentation of fluid temperature is more significant. Furthermore, a satisfactory agreement is reached when the findings of the current study are compared to those of studies that have been published in the past.",

    "Title": "Design of High-Performance Intelligent WSN based-IoT using Time Synchronized Channel Hopping and Spatial Correlation Model",
    "Abstract": "Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the most significant contributors to the Internet of Things (IoT), and it plays a significant role in the lives of individuals. There are three main problems in the design of traditional WSN based-IoT. First problem about data; the WSN transmits a huge volume of data to the IoT for processing. The second problem is the energy; since sensor nodes rely on their limited battery, conserving energy is crucial, and the third problem about efficiency of transmission. This paper presents new WSN based IoT framework that integrate important techniques to solve these problems; To increase the effectiveness of data processing and storing, the intelligent Adaptive Boosting stochastic algorithm is applied. IEEE 802.15.4e time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) protocol is used because it has the benefits such as collision-free transmission and multi-hop transmission. Data reduction at the Gateway (GW) level of the network is achieved through spatial correlation between sensors with the goal of conserving energy. Principle idea of this new framework is to identify the advantages of integrating the important techniques; intelligent Adaptive Boosting Stochastic diffusion search algorithm, TSCH, and Special correlation model. As a result, the proposed framework can thereby satisfy the need for a long battery life of low-rate applications and at the same time, the need for high throughput for high-rate uses also for testing it in achieved efficient classification of data, the important performance measures are used.",

    "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are formed of self-contained nodes of sensors that are connected to one base station or more. WSNs have several primary aims one of them is to transport network node's trustworthy information to another one. As WSNs expand, they become more vulnerable to attacks, necessitating the implementation of strong security systems. The identification of effective cryptography for WSNs is a significant problem because of the limited energy of the sensor nodes, compute capability, and storage resources. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an encryption technique implemented in this paper with three meta-heuristic algorithms which are called Hybrid Genetic Firefly algorithm, Firefly algorithm, and Genetic algorithm to ensure that the data in the WSNs is kept confidential by providing enough degrees of security. We have used hybrid Genetic firefly as a searching operator whose goal is to improve the searchability of the baseline genetic algorithm. The suggested framework's performance that based on the algorithm of hybrid genetic firefly is rated by using Convergence Graphs of the Benchmark Functions. From the graphs we have conclude that hybrid genetic firefly with AES is best from other algorithms.",

    "Abstract": "COVID-19 was discovered near the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China. In a short period, the virus had spread throughout the entire world. One of the primary concerns of managers and decision-makers in all types of hospitals nowadays is to implement detection plans for status of patient (Negative, Positive) in order to provide enough care at the proper moment. To reduce a pandemic of COVID-19, improving health care quality could be advantageous. Making clusters of patients with similar features and symptoms supplies an overview of health quality given to similar patients. In the scope of medical machine learning, the K-means and Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering algorithms are usually used to produce clusters depend on similarity and to detect helpful patterns from sizes of data. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid algorithm of K-Means and Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) called K-MP to take benefits of both PAM and K-Means to construct an efficient model for predicting patient status. The suggested model for the real dataset was collected from 400 patients in the many Iraqi clinics using a questionnaire. We evaluated the proposed K-MP by using true negative rate, balance accuracy, precision, accuracy, recall, mean absolute error, F1 score, and root mean square error. From these performance measures, we found that K-MP is more efficient in discovering patient status comparing to K-Means and PAM.",

    "Abstract": "Because plant disease is main cause of most plants’ damage, improving prediction plans for early detection of plant where it has disease or not is an essential interest of decision makers in the agricultural sector for providing proper plant care at appropriate time. Clustering and classification algorithms have proven effective in early detection of plant disease. Making clusters of plants with similar features is an excellent strategy for analyzing features and providing an overview of care quality provided to similar plants. Thus, in this article, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier and k-efficient clustering that integrates k-means with k-medoids to take advantage of both k-means and k-medoids to improve plant disease prediction strategies. Objectives of this article are to determine performance of k-mean, k-medoids and k-efficient also we compare k-NN before clustering and with clustering in prediction of soybean disease for selecting best one for plant disease forecasting. These objectives enable us to analysis data of plant that help to understand nature of plant. Results indicate that k-NN with k-efficient is more efficient than other in terms of inter-class, intra-class, normal mutual information (NMI), accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and running time.",

    "Abstract": "Sensor technology advancements have provided a viable solution to fight COVID and to develop healthcare systems based on Internet of Things (IoTs). In this study, image processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used to improve the IoT framework. Computed Tomography (CT) image-based forecasting of COVID disease is among the important activities in medicine for measuring the severity of variability in the human body. In COVID CT images, the optimal gamma correction value was optimised using the Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA). During the search for the optimal solution, WOA was found to be a highly efficient algorithm, which has the characteristics of high precision and fast convergence. Whale Optimisation Algorithm is used to find best gamma correction value to present detailed information about a lung CT image, Also, in this study, analysis of important AI techniques has been done, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep-Learning (Deep-Learning (DL)) for COVID disease forecasting in terms of amount of data training and computational power. Many experiments have been implemented to investigate the optimisation: SVM and DL with WOA and without WOA are compared by using confusion matrix parameters. From the results, we find that the DL model outperforms the SVM with WOA and without WOA.",

    "Abstract": "The study of human-computer interaction has been transformed by Signal Analysis of the Brain (SAoB). The ability to analyze human brain activity opens new opportunities for SAoB study. A medical imaging tool known as ElectroEncephalography (EEG) is the most effective way for doctors to diagnose patients with brain disorders by examining the characteristics of their brain scans. The need for a cloud-based Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based healthcare system is critical case in order to make better decisions in SAoB. EEG data are used in this study to make predictions about EEG signal classification using prior knowledge. We used supervised mining methods to distinguish between two types of EEG (Normal and Abnormal). Reduction of dimensionality and extraction of a feature are implemented on the EEG dataset to obtain high-level features which assisted to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the supervised mining algorithms. To quickly identify signal analysis cases from EEG data, this work proposes eight supervised mining algorithms, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Decision Table (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), One Rule (OneR), Decision Stump (DS), Zero Rule (ZeroR), and Random Forest (RF). After choosing the important features, these eight algorithms were sorely tested in an experiment. On an EEG dataset. Seven of the eight algorithms tested yielded results with greater than 90% accuracy and the ANN algorithm is the best because it achieved 97% but its take longer time in implementing (42 second). Based on these findings, we believe that these seven algorithms provide excellent and precise EEG signal identification and processing. Additionally, this research proposes a personalized health care system based on IoMT-cloud based SAoB and studies EEG brain classification.",

    "Title": "Improved Secure IoTs-Based Visual Computing with Image Processing and Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Accurate Predicting of Novel COVID",
    "Abstract": "Secure Internet of Things (IoTs) have evolved into a requirement for electronic healthcare systems. In most cases, health images contain sensitive information about patients that must be protected. Traditional encryption cannot be directly applied to image data due to restrictions in digital data attributes. Additionally, patients may lose the confidentiality of their data when private images are transmitted via a network. Thus, multimedia Artificial Intelligence and image processing are applied to build improved secure IoTs. To guarantee accurate and privately protected e-health services, a secure lightweight key frame extraction approach is essential. Additionally, when taking into account the limitations of real-time e-health systems, it can be challenging to establish a satisfactory degree of security in an economical manner. An encryption scheme that contain a hashing version of the Blum Blum Shub (BBS) generator, namely Hash-BBS (HBBS) is suggested and built to achieve a high grade of integrity and confidentiality in transmission data of COVID-19 CT-images for patients. Also, an AI technique is applied for COVID-19 testing such as adopted a convolutional neural network. Evaluation showed that the proposed framework outperformed alternative security and transfer learning methodologies in secure prediction. Therefore, it can be used to reliably transmit CT-images for COVID-19 patients while meeting strict security and prediction benchmarks.",

The first experiment was carried out without use of feature selection and the second experiment was run with features selection techniques that are implemented in WEKA to assist in making decisions to forecast and improve plant health. Lastly, we evaluate a suggested framework in two experiments using k-fold cross-validation. K-NN combined with ReliefFAttributeEval performs exceptionally well.",

    "Abstract": "There is a need for increased security measures because of wide variety of android Internet of Thing (IoT) mobile devices that can communicate with each other via networks for controlling the management of enterprise. Elliptic Curve Deffie Hellman (ECDH) and Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) are used to secure data in android IoT phones in efficient manner. Android mobile can store a lot of data, including sensitive data. Protecting data saved on mobile has become a critical problem. In android IoT, Collaborative Machine Learning describes a method for collaboratively mining data, which makes it easier to manage and lowers cost of maintenance. To increase security in IoT phones, suggested system uses ECDH, RSA, and CML algorithms, which have been considered novelty of this method. RSA and ECDH are computed using time of decryption, encryption, and key generation. Conclusions show ECDH beats other alternatives like RSA. Finally, all users of the network have been tested.",

    "Abstract": "Many commonplace issues may be addressed with the help of the Internet of Things (IoTs). We provide an efficient solution to test classification and status of flowers images by combining Deep Learning (DL) and IoTs. Due to the diversity of flower species, classifying and determining the status of flowers is a difficult undertaking. in this study, two-phase DL to differentiating between flowers of several species are developed into the application of mobile that discovers the type of flower so that describing the amount of water required for the daily irrigation for every kind of flower. First, the flower region is automatically segmented using Markov Random Fields (MRF) approach. Second, build a robust DL by using four models such as VCG-16, inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and RestNet-18 to distinguish the different flower types. In this way, the system keeps track of the amount of water in the soil and uses water wisely while appreciating the user. To evaluate the flower's state, which is being tracked by nearby sensor devices, a cloud-based server and a mobile application are used in the flower status tracker implementation. The results show that the VCG with segmentation has the highest accuracy than other models but it has longer time in implementing.",

    "Title": "Deep Learning Techniques for Pattern Recognition in EEG Audio Signal-Processing-Based Eye-Closed and Eye-Open Cases",
    "Abstract": "Recently, pattern recognition in audio signal processing using electroencephalography (EEG) has attracted significant attention. Changes in eye cases (open or closed) are reflected in distinct patterns in EEG data, gathered across a range of cases and actions. Therefore, the accuracy of extracting other information from these signals depends significantly on the prediction of the eye case during the acquisition of EEG signals. In this paper, we use deep learning vector quantization (DLVQ), and feedforward artificial neural network (F-FANN) techniques to recognize the case of the eye. The DLVQ is superior to traditional VQ in classification issues due to its ability to learn a code-constrained codebook. On initialization by the k-means VQ approach, the DLVQ shows very promising performance when tested on an EEG-audio information retrieval task, while F-FANN classifies EEG-audio signals of eye state as open or closed. The DLVQ model achieves higher classification accuracy, higher F score, precision, and recall, as well as superior classification abilities as compared to the F-FANN.",

    "Abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) based on fog/cloud computing has been effectively proven to improve the controlling, monitoring, and care quality of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. One of the convenient approaches to assess symptomatic patients is to group patients with comparable symptoms and provide an overview of the required level of care to patients with similar conditions. Therefore, this study adopts an effective hierarchal IoMTs computing with K-Efficient clustering to control and forecast COVID-19 cases. The proposed system integrates the K-Means and K-Medoids clusterings to monitor the health status of patients, early detection of COVID-19 cases, and process data in real-time with ultra-low latency. In addition, the data analysis takes into account the primary requirements of the network to assist in understanding the nature of COVID-19. Based on the findings, the K-Efficient clustering with fog computing is a more effective approach to analyse the status of patients compared to that of K-Means and K-Medoids in terms of intra-class, inter-class, running time, the latency of network, and RAM consumption. In summary, the outcome of this study provides a novel approach for remote monitoring and handling of infected COVID-19 patients through real-time personalised treatment services.",

    "Abstract": "Because of the big volume of marketing data, a human analyst would be unable to uncover any useful information for marketing that could aid in the process of making decision. Smart Data Mining (SDM), which is considered an important field from Artificial Intelligence (AI) is completely assisting in the performance business management analytics and marketing information. In this study, most reliable six algorithms in SDM are applied; Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ID3, and C4.5 on actual data of marketing for bank that taken from Cloud Internet of Thing (CIoT). The objectives of this study are to build an efficient framework to increase campaign of marketing for banks by identifying main characteristics that affect a success and to test the performance of CIoT and SDM algorithms. This study is expected to enhance the scientific contributions to investigating the marketing information capacities by integrating SDM with CIoT. The performances of SDM algorithms are calculated by eight measures; accuracy, balance accuracy, precision, mean absolute error, root mean absolute error, recall, F1- Score and running time. The experimental findings show that the proposed framework is successful, with higher accuracies and good performance. Results revealed that customer service & marketing tactics are essential for a Company’ success & survival. Also, the C4.5 has accomplished better achievement than the SVM, RF, LR, NB, & ID3. At the end, CIoT Platform was evaluated by response time, request rate & processing of bank data.",

    "Title": "Multi-phase dynamic constraint aggregation for set partitioning type problems",
    "Abstract": "Dynamic constraint aggregation is an iterative method that was recently introduced to speed up the linear relaxation solution process of set partitioning type problems. This speed up is mostly due to the use, at each iteration, of an aggregated problem defined by aggregating disjoint subsets of constraints from the set partitioning model. This aggregation is updated when needed to ensure the exactness of the overall approach. In this paper, we propose a new version of this method, called the multi-phase dynamic constraint aggregation method, which essentially adds to the original method a partial pricing strategy that involves multiple phases. This strategy helps keeping the size of the aggregated problem as small as possible, yielding a faster average computation time per iteration and fewer iterations. We also establish theoretical results that provide some insights explaining the success of the proposed …",

    "Title": "An improved primal simplex algorithm for degenerate linear programs",
    "Abstract": "Since its appearance in 1947, the primal simplex algorithm has been one of the most popular algorithms for solving linear programs. It is often very efficient when there is very little degeneracy, but it often struggles in the presence of high degeneracy, executing many pivots without improving the objective function value. In this paper, we propose an improved primal simplex algorithm that deals with this issue. This algorithm is based on new theoretical results that shed light on how to reduce the negative impact of degeneracy. In particular, we show that, from a nonoptimal basic solution with p positive-valued variables, there exists a sequence of at most m - p + 1 simplex pivots that guarantee the improvement of the objective value, where m is the number of constraints in the linear program. These pivots can be identified by solving an auxiliary linear program. Finally, we briefly summarize computational results that …",

    "Title": "A modified choice function hyper-heuristic with Boltzmann function",
    "Abstract": "Hyper-heuristics are a subclass of high-level research methods that function in a low-level heuristic research space. Their aim objective is to improve the level of generality for solving combinatorial optimization problems using two main components: a methodology for the heuristic selection and a move acceptance criterion, to ensure intensification and diversification [1]. Thus, rather than working directly on the problem’s solutions and selecting one of them to proceed to the next step at each stage, hyper-heuristics operates on a low-level heuristic research space. The choice function is one of the hyper-heuristics that have proven their efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems [2–4]. At each iteration, the selection of heuristics is dependent on a score calculated by combining three different measures to guarantee both intensification and diversification for the heuristics choice process. The heuristic with the highest score is therefore chosen to be applied to the problem. Therefore, the key to the success of the choice function is to choose the correct weight parameters of its three measures. In this study, we make a state of the art in hyper-heuristic research and propose a new method that automatically controls these weight parameters based on the Boltzmann function. The results obtained from its application on five problem domains are compared with those of the standard, modified choice function proposed by Drake et al.[2, 3].",

    "Title": "A survey on constructing Lyapunov functions for reaction-diffusion systems with delay and their application in biology",
    "Abstract": "Motivated by some biological and ecological problems given by reaction-diffusion systems with delays and boundary conditions of Neumann type and knowing their associated Lyapunov functions for delay ordinary differential equations, we consider a method for determining their Lyapunov functions to establish the local/global stability. The method is essentially based on adding integral terms to the corresponding Lyapunov function for ordinary differential equations. The new approach is not general but it is applicable in a wide variety of delays reaction-diffusion models with one discrete delay or more, distributed delay, and a combination of both of them. To illustrate our results, we present the method application to a reaction-diffusion epidemiological model with time delay (latency period) and indirect transmission effect.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, we consider an epidemiological model in which we take into account the effects of direct and indirect transmissions. The first mode occurs through direct contact between infectious and susceptible individuals, and the second one will take place through the shedding of virus particles by infectious individuals and their acquisition by susceptible ones. We also study the effect of latency period and time needed for a susceptible person to become infected by indirect transmission mode. By considering the direct and indirect basic reproduction numbers, we define the basic reproduction number R 0 {R}_{0} of the model, which helps us to analyze the stability of equilibria and bifurcation and determine the most sensitive parameters. In conclusion, some numerical simulations are given to confirm the analytical analysis.",

The model is given in reaction diffusion systems with two delays which represent the local interaction and the propagation of the virus in tissues. The reduced and layer subsystems are studied and we establish that the slow man-ifold is an attracting one. We prove that the diffusion has no effect on the dynamics of the system, but time delays can modify the dy-namics of the system with/without diffusion.

The model (called SIARD) is given by a system of differential equations which model the interactions between five populations \"susceptible\", \"reported infectious\", \"unreported infectious\", \"recovered with/without non total immunity\"and \"death\". Depending on the basic reproduction number, we prove that the total immunity induces local stability-instability of equilibria and the epidemic may disappear after a first epidemic wave and more epidemic waves may appear in the case of non-total immunity. Using the sensitivity analysis we identify the most sensitive parameters. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate our theoretical results. As an application, we found that our model fits well the Moroccan epidemic wave, and predicts more than one wave for French case.",

Depending on the time delay, we analyze the positivity and boundedness of solutions and the stability of tumour, infected and uninfected free equilibria (TFE, IFE, UFE) and uninfected-infected equilibrium (UIE) is established. We prove that, delay can lead to \"Jeff's phenomenon\"observed in a laboratory which causes oscillations in tumour size whose phase and period change over time. With nonlinear dependence of UIE equilibrium on time delay, we develop a more general algorithm determining the stability/instability of the oscillating periodic solutions bifurcating from the UIE equilibrium.

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a reaction-diffusion mathematical model augmented with self/cross-diffusion in 2D domain which describes the oncolytic virotherapy treatment of a tumor with its growth following the logistic law. The tumor cells are divided into uninfected and infected cells and the virus transmission is supposed to be in a direct mode (from cell to cell). In the absence of cross-diffusion, we establish well posedness of the problem, non-negativity and boundedness of solutions, nonexistence of positive solutions, local and global stability of the nontrivial steady-state and the nonoccurrence of Turing instability. In the presence of cross-diffusion, we prove the occurrence of Turing instability by using the cross-diffusion coefficient of infected cells as a parameter. To have an idea about different patterns, we derive the corresponding amplitude equation by using the nonlinear analysis theory. In the end, we perform some numerical simulations to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.",

    "Title": "Multi-phase dynamic constraint aggregation for set partitioning type problems",
    "Abstract": "Dynamic constraint aggregation is an iterative method that was recently introduced to speed up the linear relaxation solution process of set partitioning type problems. This speed up is mostly due to the use, at each iteration, of an aggregated problem defined by aggregating disjoint subsets of constraints from the set partitioning model. This aggregation is updated when needed to ensure the exactness of the overall approach. In this paper, we propose a new version of this method, called the multi-phase dynamic constraint aggregation method, which essentially adds to the original method a partial pricing strategy that involves multiple phases. This strategy helps keeping the size of the aggregated problem as small as possible, yielding a faster average computation time per iteration and fewer iterations. We also establish theoretical results that provide some insights explaining the success of the proposed …",

    "Title": "An improved primal simplex algorithm for degenerate linear programs",
    "Abstract": "Since its appearance in 1947, the primal simplex algorithm has been one of the most popular algorithms for solving linear programs. It is often very efficient when there is very little degeneracy, but it often struggles in the presence of high degeneracy, executing many pivots without improving the objective function value. In this paper, we propose an improved primal simplex algorithm that deals with this issue. This algorithm is based on new theoretical results that shed light on how to reduce the negative impact of degeneracy. In particular, we show that, from a nonoptimal basic solution with p positive-valued variables, there exists a sequence of at most m - p + 1 simplex pivots that guarantee the improvement of the objective value, where m is the number of constraints in the linear program. These pivots can be identified by solving an auxiliary linear program. Finally, we briefly summarize computational results that …",

It reduces the master problem size by aggregating some of its constraints and updates this aggregation when needed. In this paper, we present an advanced version of the dynamic constraint aggregation that reduces both the master problem and the subproblem sizes. This version is called the bi-dynamic constraint aggregation method because aggregation is dynamically applied to both the master problem and the subproblem. We also discuss solution integrality.

We first introduce a new definition of an adequate concept of lower and upper level sets and establish some of their topological and geometrical properties. A characterization of semicontinuity for vector-valued mappings is thereafter presented. Then, we define a concept of vector lower limit, proving its lower semicontinuity, and furnishing in this way a concept of lower semicontinuous regularization for mappings taking their values in a complete lattice. The results obtained in the present work subsume the standard ones when the target space is finite dimensional. In particular, we recapture the scalar case with a new flexible proof. In addition, extensions of usual operations of lower and upper limits for vector-valued mappings are explored. The main result is finally …",

We show that IDCA improves the dynamic constraint aggregation (DCA) and the multiphase dynamic constraint aggregation (MPDCA) algorithms (Elhallaoui et al., 2005, 2010) that not only reduce degeneracy but also profit from it to efficiently solve set partitioning problems.

The third algorithm is a mixed implementation that adds some original variables and some extreme points of a subproblem to the master problem.

    "Title": "A modified choice function hyper-heuristic with Boltzmann function",
    "Abstract": "Hyper-heuristics are a subclass of high-level research methods that function in a low-level heuristic research space. Their aim objective is to improve the level of generality for solving combinatorial optimization problems using two main components: a methodology for the heuristic selection and a move acceptance criterion, to ensure intensification and diversification [1]. Thus, rather than working directly on the problem’s solutions and selecting one of them to proceed to the next step at each stage, hyper-heuristics operates on a low-level heuristic research space. The choice function is one of the hyper-heuristics that have proven their efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems [2–4]. At each iteration, the selection of heuristics is dependent on a score calculated by combining three different measures to guarantee both intensification and diversification for the heuristics choice process. The heuristic with the highest score is therefore chosen to be applied to the problem. Therefore, the key to the success of the choice function is to choose the correct weight parameters of its three measures. In this study, we make a state of the art in hyper-heuristic research and propose a new method that automatically controls these weight parameters based on the Boltzmann function. The results obtained from its application on five problem domains are compared with those of the standard, modified choice function proposed by Drake et al.[2, 3].",

    "Abstract": "Vehicle routing problems are widely available in real world application. In this paper, we tackle the resolution of a specific variant of the problem called in the literature vehicle routing problem with flexible time windows (VRPFlexTW), when the solution has to obey several other constraints, such as the consideration of travel, service, and waiting time together with time-window restrictions. There are proposed two modified versions of the Multi-objective Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (MOALNS). The MOALNS approach and its different components are described. Also it is listed a computational comparison between the MOALNS versions and the Ant colony optimiser (ACO) on a few instances of the VRPFlexTW.",

    "Title": "Roadmap for an Arabic Controlled Language",
    "Abstract": "Controlled Natural Languages or CNLs are artificial subsets of natural languages that aim to make communication clearer and more precise. In general, CNLs are used in communication between humans or with computers and, particularly, when clarity and unambiguity are required. Existing CNLs have been developed to be exploited in many applications such as technical documentation, machine translation or database query language. So far, many CNLs have been developed for Western languages, especially English, but no concrete CNL has yet been proposed for Arabic even with the increasing number of Arabic Internet users in the last two decades. In this paper, we propose a roadmap for developing an Arabic CNL to provide new kind and advanced natural language services for Arabic people. Methodologically speaking, we review the most important existing CNLs in English and other languages helping us knowing some statistics related to the vocabulary size and the number of grammar rules that could help in designing the new CNL. This paper proposes two major approaches; one relies on leveraging on already-built CNLs, whereas the other consists in starting from scratch. The survey of Arabic NLP challenges along the available resources and tools allowed us to favor the second approach as the basis for the proposed roadmap.",

    "Title": "An Enhanced Fluid Registration for Image Multi-Frame Super Resolution",
    "Abstract": "The main idea of multi-frame super resolution (SR) algorithms is to recover a single high-resolution image from a sequence of low resolution ones of the same object. The success of the SR approaches is often related to a well registration and restoration steps. Therefore, we propose a new approach based on fluid image registration and we use a second order partial differential equation (PDE) to treat both the registration and restoration steps that guarantees the success of SR algorithms. Since the registration step is usually a variational ill-posed model, a mathematical study is needed to check the existence of the solution to the regularized problem. Thus, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the well posed fluid image registration and assure also the existence of the used second order PDE in the restoration step. The results show that the proposed method is competitive with the existing methods.",

    "Abstract": "The framework of this article is to introduce a new efficient Blind Source Separation (BSS) method that handles mixtures of noise-contaminated independent / dependent sources. In order to achieve that, one can minimize a criterion that fuses a separating part, based on Kullback–Leibler divergence to set apart the observed mixtures of either dependent or independent sources, with a regularization part that employs the bilateral total variation (BTV) for the purpose of denoising the observations. The proposed algorithm utilizes a primal-dual algorithm to remove the noise, while a gradient descent method is implemented to retrieve the source signals. Our algorithm has shown its effectiveness and efficiency toward the noisy dependent / independent sources and also surpassed the standard BSS algorithms through different experimental results.",

    "Abstract": "The main idea of multi-frame super-resolution (SR) algorithm is to recover a single high-resolution (HR) image from a sequence of low resolution ones of the same scene. Since the restoration step of super-resolution algorithms is always an ill-posed problem, the choice of the fidelity term and the regularization are always crucial. In this paper, we propose a new variational SR framework based on an automatic selection of the weighting parameter that control the balance between the L1 and L2 fidelity terms, which handle different type of noise distributions. Concerning the regularization, we use the combined total variation (TV) and the total variation of the first derivatives (TV2) model with a new implementation of the Primal-dual algorithm to solve the corresponding discretized problem. The obtained results are compared with some competitive algorithms and confirm that the proposed method has much benefices over the others in avoiding some undesirable artifacts.",

    "Title": "An ontological model based on machine learning for predicting breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is mostly a female disease, but it may affect men as well even at a considerably lower percentage. An automated diagnosis system should be built for early detection because manual breast cancer diagnosis takes a long time. Doctors have lately achieved significant advances in the early identification and treatment of breast cancer in order to decrease the rate of mortality caused by the latter. Researchers, on the other hand, are analysing large amounts of complicated medical data by employing a combination of statistical and machine learning methodologies to assist clinicians in predicting breast cancer. Various machine learning approaches, including ontology-based Machine Learning methods, have lately played an essential role in medical science by building an automated system that can identify breast cancer. This study examines and evaluates the most popular machine learning algorithms, besides the ontological model based on Machine Learning. Among the classification methods investigated were Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbours. The dataset utilized has 683 instances and is available for download from the Kaggle website. The findings are assessed using performance measures generated from the confusion matrix, such as F-Measure, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. The ontology model surpassed all machine learning techniques, according to the results.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, the database field has gotten much more diverse, and as a result, a variety of non-relational (NoSQL) databases have been created, including JSON-document databases and key-value stores, as well as extensible markup language (XML) and graph databases. Due to the emergence of a new generation of data services, some of the problems associated with big data have been resolved. In addition, in the haste to address the challenges of big data, NoSQL abandoned several core databases features that make them extremely efficient and functional, for instance the global view, which enables users to access data regardless of how it is logically structured or physically stored in its sources. In this article, we propose a method that allows us to query non-relational databases based on the ontology-based access data (OBDA) framework by delegating SPARQL protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) queries from ontology to the NoSQL database. We applied the method on a popular database called Couchbase and we discussed the result obtained.",

    "Title": "A highly scalable CF recommendation system using ontology and SVD-based incremental approach",
    "Abstract": "In recent years, the need of recommender systems has increased to enhance user engagement, provide personalized services, and increase revenue, especially in the online shopping industry where vast amounts of customer data are generated. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used and effective approach for generating appropriate recommendations. However, the current CF approach has limitations in addressing common recommendation problems such as data inaccuracy recommendations, sparsity, scalability, and significant errors in prediction. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid CF method for movie recommendations that combines the incremental singular value decomposition approach with an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach in two phases, online and offline. The ontology-based technique is leveraged to enhance the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. Evaluating our method on a real-world movie recommendation dataset using precision, F1 scores, and mean absolute error (MAE) demonstrates that our system generates accurate predictions while addressing sparsity and scalability issues in recommendation system. Additionally, our method has the advantage of reduced running time.",

    "Title": "Unified and evolved approach based on neural network and deep learning methods for intrusion detection",
    "Abstract": "Currently, network security has become a major concern for all entities around the world. Attackers employ various methods to disrupt services, which requires new methods to stop them all in one way. Moreover, these intrusions can evolve and overcome security measures and devices, which pushes to use new evolving methods able to accompany the evolution of these threats, to block them. In our paper, we propose a new approach for intrusion detection, founded on neural network (NN) and deep learning (DL) methods. This approach is planned to not only identify threats, but also to develop a long-term memory of them, in order to detect new ones resembling these memorized attacks, and simultaneously, to provide a single way to stop all kinds of intrusions. To test our model, we have chosen the most recently employed methods in literature, NN and DL algorithms: feedforward neural network (FNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), then we have applied them on network security layer-knowledge discovery in databases (NSL KDD) intrusions dataset. The results of experiments were impressive for all the algorithms, with maximum performances noted by LSTM, which affirms the efficacy of our proposed method for intrusion detection.",

Utilizing a dataset of New York City yellow taxi trips from 2023, the analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training. The data consists of over 12 million records, managed, and processed that involves configuring the Spark driver and executor memory to efficiently process the Parquet-format data stored on hadoop distributed file system (HDFS). Key features influencing fare amount, such as passenger count, trip distance, fare amount, and tip amount, were analyzed for correlation. Models were trained on an 80-20 train-test split, and their performance was evaluated using root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean squared error (MSE). Results show that both methods provide comparable accuracy, with slight differences in coefficients and training time. Additionally, vendor performance metrics, including total trips, average trip distance, fare amount, and tip amount, were analyzed to reveal trends and inform strategic decisions for fleet management. This comprehensive analysis demonstrates the efficacy of linear regression techniques in predicting taxi fares and offers valuable insights for optimizing taxi operations.",

    "Title": "Optimization of the impact measurement of market structure on liquidity and volatility",
    "Abstract": "Liquidity and volatility are the two barometers that allow stock markets to appreciate in terms of attractiveness, profitability and efficiency. Several macroeconomic and microstructure variables condition the level of liquidity that directly impact the asset allocation decisions of different investor profiles - institutional and individuals - and therefore the dynamics of the market as a whole. Volatility is the regulatory component that provides information on the level of risk that characterizes the market. Thus, the appreciation of these two elements is of considerable help to fund managers looking to optimize their equity pockets. In this work, we will use the liquidity ratio as a proxy variable for the liquidity of the Moroccan stock market, to estimate the indicators and factors that determine its short- and long-term variability. The appropriate econometric method would be to estimate an error correction vector model (ECVM) which has the property of determining the long- and short-term relationships between the variables. The volatility of the MASI index will be the subject of a second estimate to capture the shape of the function of its evolution.",

This is true regardless of the underlying asset of the futures contracts considered, whether they are commodities, interest rates, exchange rates, shares, stock market indices, etc. By locking in future prices, the primary objective of these markets is to limit the risks faced by operators. This article proposes a new method of optimizing the coverage ratio by futures contracts to minimize price variance and thus apply this new technique to reduce the risk associated with Brent price volatility for the period from January 2010 to December 2020. The variance minimization model of Ederington's (1979) is the first and most widely used coverage model and the one that dominates the literature on this area which helps to find the optimal coverage ratio, and is also the objective function in our particle assay optimization algorithm in MATLAB and we will better interpret our results with statistical analysis and lastly, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the coverage model.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer constitutes a significant threat to women's health worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports around 2.3 million new cases each year, making this disease the primary reason for cancer-related fatalities among women. In light of this alarming situation, developing innovative tools for early detection and optimal treatment is imperative, as it directly addresses the pressing need to enhance our capabilities in the quest to overcome breast cancer. This study fits in with this approach, introducing a comparative assessment of multiple machine learning algorithms and integrating data preprocessing, data balancing and feature selection techniques. The studied Coimbra dataset, composed of 116 records and including 10 medical characteristics, exhibited promising performance in all classification metrics, reaching an accuracy of 89.74%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 89.68%. These findings highlight the significant potential of our approaches to improve breast cancer treatment and detection systems, providing health practitioners with more efficient resources., Adaptive synthetic sampling, Ant colony optimization, Breast cancer, Machine learning.",

    "Title": "Enhancing hypertension prediction: a hybrid machine learning optimization approach",
    "Abstract": "Early identification of hypertension is crucial to prevent its serious complications, which can lead to devastating health effects by threatening lifestyle quality and significantly increasing premature mortality. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting the presence of hypertension from an unbalanced dataset consisting of 4,363 records and 35 features. To balance the dataset, we employed the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm. In addition, to select the most relevant features, we used ant colony optimization. Next, we applied various algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), support vector machine (SVM), extra trees (ETs), and AdaBoost (AB). We also evaluated the optimization of hyperparameters using two methods: Bayesian optimization (BO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results reveal that the combination of AB with BO demonstrated superior performance, with an accuracy of 97.60%, a recall of 98.93%, and a precision of 98.59%. This research emphasizes the potential of machine learning techniques for anticipating hypertension and highlights the importance of optimization techniques in improving predictive models’ performance.",

The motivation behind this work is to propose a new approach that estimates the infection rate parameter in the SEIR model. However, this model may have limited predictive value due to the idealized assumptions underlying it and measurement errors in the experimental data and parameters. We first implement this model as a paradigm because of its application to more realistic epidemic models, then we present our theoretical results.

However, the development of high level and intelligent applications such as Question Answering (QA) systems is still obstructed by the lacks in terms of ontologies and other semantic resources.

Integrating a controlled natural language makes the platform more comfortable (for users), more powerful and helps so to eliminate this weakness.

    "Title": "Roadmap for an Arabic Controlled Language",
    "Abstract": "Controlled Natural Languages or CNLs are artificial subsets of natural languages that aim to make communication clearer and more precise. In general, CNLs are used in communication between humans or with computers and, particularly, when clarity and unambiguity are required. Existing CNLs have been developed to be exploited in many applications such as technical documentation, machine translation or database query language. So far, many CNLs have been developed for Western languages, especially English, but no concrete CNL has yet been proposed for Arabic even with the increasing number of Arabic Internet users in the last two decades. In this paper, we propose a roadmap for developing an Arabic CNL to provide new kind and advanced natural language services for Arabic people. Methodologically speaking, we review the most important existing CNLs in English and other languages helping us knowing some statistics related to the vocabulary size and the number of grammar rules that could help in designing the new CNL. This paper proposes two major approaches; one relies on leveraging on already-built CNLs, whereas the other consists in starting from scratch. The survey of Arabic NLP challenges along the available resources and tools allowed us to favor the second approach as the basis for the proposed roadmap.",

    "Title": "TOWARDS A FULLY CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM FOR ARABIC NLP",
    "Abstract": "Cloud Computing is getting more and more debated in the IT industry today. Its evolution is leading the next generation of internet services. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on understanding, manipulating and generating human language by machines. Thus, the NLP is really at the interface between computer science and linguistics. It, therefore, concerns the ability of the machine to interact directly with humans. Arabic NLP is very poor compared to other languages such as English or German due to the complexity of this language and the lack of resources. In this work, we propose a new system for Arabic NLP based entirely on the Cloud. This system is based on two steps. It firstly uses a bridge between Arabic and other developed languages (English for occurrence) and then uses of the already developed features for that language. Hence those features apply not on the Arabic text but instead on the translated (the English) one. In some cases, the result needs to be in Arabic, in which case, we use the bridge another time to translate English result into Arabic. This can either be used in real NLP systems, such as Translation, IR, QA, Sentiment Analysis, or for validation or comparison purposes, especially for those who work in NLP and use other approaches. Experiments have been performed on a prototype we developed and the results obtained are satisfactory for this first version.",

    "Abstract": "When solving the problem of identifying similar records in different datasets (known as Entity Resolution or ER), one big challenge is the lack of enough labeled data. Which is crucial for building strong machine learning models, but getting this data can be expensive and time-consuming. Active Machine Learning (ActiveML) is a helpful approach because it cleverly picks the most useful pieces of data to learn from. It uses two main ideas: informativeness and representativeness. Typical ActiveML methods used in ER usually depend too much on just one of these ideas, which can make them less effective, especially when starting with very little data. Our research introduces a new combined method that uses both ideas together. We created two versions of this method, called DPQ and STQ, and tested them on eleven different real-world datasets. The results showed that our new method improves ER by producing better scores, more stable models, and faster learning with less training data compared to existing methods.",

    "Title": "Sentiment analysis dataset in Moroccan dialect: bridging the gap between Arabic and Latin scripted dialect",
    "Abstract": "Sentiment analysis, the automated process of determining emotions or opinions expressed in text, has seen extensive exploration in the field of natural language processing. However, one aspect that has remained underrepresented is the sentiment analysis of the Moroccan dialect, which boasts a unique linguistic landscape and the coexistence of multiple scripts. Previous works in sentiment analysis primarily targeted dialects employing Arabic script. While these efforts provided valuable insights, they may not fully capture the complexity of Moroccan web content, which features a blend of Arabic and Latin script. As a result, our study emphasizes the importance of extending sentiment analysis to encompass the entire spectrum of Moroccan linguistic diversity. Central to our research is the creation of the largest public dataset for Moroccan dialect sentiment analysis that incorporates not only Moroccan dialect written in Arabic script but also in Latin characters. By assembling a diverse range of textual data, we were able to construct a dataset with a range of 19,991 manually labeled texts in Moroccan dialect and also publicly available lists of stop words in Moroccan dialect as a new contribution to Moroccan Arabic resources. In our exploration of sentiment analysis, we undertook a comprehensive study encompassing various machine-learning models to assess their compatibility with our dataset. While our investigation revealed that the highest accuracy of 98.42% was attained through the utilization of the DarijaBert-mix transfer-learning model, we also delved into deep learning models. Notably, our experimentation yielded a commendable accuracy rate of 92% when employing a CNN model. Furthermore, in an effort to affirm the reliability of our dataset, we tested the CNN model using smaller publicly available datasets of Moroccan dialect, with results that proved to be promising and supportive of our findings.",

    "Title": "ERABQS: entity resolution based on active machine learning and balancing query strategy",
    "Abstract": "Entity Resolution (ER) is a crucial process in the field of data management and integration. The primary goal of ER is to identify different profiles (or records) that refer to the same real-world entity across databases. The challenging problem is that labeling a large sample of profiles can be very expensive and time-consuming. Active Machine Learning (ActiveML) addresses this issue by selecting the most representative or informative profiles pairs to be labeled. The informativeness is determined by the capacity to diminish the uncertainty of the model. Conversely, representativeness evaluates whether a selected instance effectively reflects the overall input patterns of unlabeled data. Traditional ActiveML techniques typically rely on one strategy, Which may severely restrict the performance of the ActiveML process and lead to slow convergence. Especially in ER problems with a lack of initial training data. In this paper, we overcame this issue by inventing an approach for balancing the two above strategies. The implemented solution named EBEES (Epsilon-based Balancing Exploration and Exploitation Strategy), Which contains two variations: Adaptive-ϵ and ϵ-decreasing. We evaluated the EBEES on twelve datasets. Comparing the EBEES strategy against the state-of-the-art methods, without an initial training data, showed an enhanced performance in terms of F1-score, model stability, and rapid convergence.",

The problem is formulated as a non-smooth PDE-constrained optimization model. This PDE is constructed by second- and fourth-order diffusive tensors that combines the benefits from the diffusion model of Perona–Malik in the homogeneous regions, the Weickert model near sharp edges and the fourth-order term in reducing staircasing. The existence and uniqueness of solutions for the proposed PDE-constrained optimization system are provided in a suitable Sobolev space. Also, an optimization problem for the determination of the weighting parameter is introduced based on the Primal–Dual algorithm.

We first establish formally a relationship between the Cauchy problem and an interface problem illustrated in a rectangular structure divided into two domains. This relationship allows us to use classical methods of non-overlapping domain decomposition to develop some regularizing and stable algorithms for solving elliptic inverse Cauchy problem. Taking advantage of this relationship we reformulate this inverse problem into a fixed point one, based on Steklov–Poincaré operator. Thus, using the topological degree of Leray–Schauder we show an existence result. Finally, the efficiency and the accuracy of the developed algorithms are discussed.",

However, the success of these methods depends on some sensitive parameters which have to be manually tuned. Recently, an improved strategy to avoid this illness is to learn these parameters from some available data. In this work we propose an improved super-resolution method with bilevel optimization technique to learn the spatially dependent parameter λ that controls the diffusivity of the fractional tensor of the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to remove both Gaussian and speckle noises. Also, we elaborate a mathematical well-posedness of the optimal control problem and we introduce a projected quasi-Newton algorithm to compute the HR image X and the associated parameter λ.

The inverse problem is solved via a shape optimization formulation. Two cost functions are investigated, namely, the least squares fitting, and the Kohn-Vogelius function. In this case, the existence of the shape derivative is given via the first order material derivative of the state problems. Furthermore, using the adjoint approach, the shape gradient of both cost functions is characterized. Then, the stability is investigated by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the critical shape for both considered cases. Finally, based on the gradient method, a steepest descent algorithm is developed, and some numerical experiments for non-parametric shapes are discussed.\n1. Introduction.

For this reason, customers face problems in making decisions about the choice of the operators that gives them a better report price/QoS. Mathematical modeling of this decision support problem led to the resolution of an inverse problem. More precisely, the inverse problem is to find the function of the QoS real knowing the QoS theoretical or advertising. This model will help customers who seek to know the degree of sincerity of their operators, as well as it is an opportunity for operators who want to maintain their resources so that they gain the trust of customers.

To circumvent these issues, we transform two-constraint optimization models using the penalty method into an unconstrained non-smooth optimization one.

    "Abstract": "Image denoising is an active field in image processing. This paper proposes a new reaction diffusion equation with a variable p (x)-exponent with a combination with a Weickert-type term to control the singular part caused by the Poisson noise. Since the introduced PDE is complicated, a theoretical study is involved. We construct in fact a Galerkin approximation for the studied equation to ensure the existence of a weak solution for the problem. Finally, representative experiments and comparisons to other denoising models are done to ensure the proposed reaction diffusion choice.\n1. Introduction. Image denoising is mandatory as a preprocessing step in different areas such as medical, military, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ultrasound images. Images can be contaminated by noise in the process of acquisition due to environmental conditions and the process of transmission and processing. The purpose of image denoising is to build a clean image from a noisy input one. Obtaining such images requires that every pixel can be expressed as a function of the noise. In this context the multiplicative noise model expresses the observed image as a product of the noise and the original image:",

    "Abstract": "Handwriting recognition, particularly for Arabic, is a very challenging field of research due to various complex factors, such as the presence of ligatures, cursive writing style, slant variations, diacritics, overlapping and other difficult problems. This paper specifically addresses the task of recognizing offline Arabic handwritten text lines. The main contributions include the pre-processing stage and the utilization of a deep learning-based approach with data-augmentation techniques. The pre-processing step involves correcting the skew of text-lines and removing any unnecessary white space in images. The deep-learning architecture consists of a Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional Block Attention Module for feature extraction, along with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory for sequence modeling and Connectionist Temporal Classification as a decoder. Data-augmentation techniques are utilized on the images in the database to enhance the system’s ability to recognize a wide range of Arabic characters and to extend the level of abstraction in patterns due to synthetic variations. Our suggested approach has the capability of precisely recognizing Arabic handwritten texts without the necessity of character segmentation, thereby resolving various issues associated with this aspect. The results obtained from the KHATT database highlight the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating a Word Error Rate of 14.55% and a Character Error Rate of 3.25%.",

    "Abstract": "Cloud Computing is getting more and more debated in the IT industry today. Its evolution is leading the next generation of internet services. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on understanding, manipulating and generating human language by machines. Thus, the NLP is really at the interface between computer science and linguistics. It, therefore, concerns the ability of the machine to interact directly with humans. Arabic NLP is very poor compared to other languages such as English or German due to the complexity of this language and the lack of resources. In this work, we propose a new system for Arabic NLP based entirely on the Cloud. This system is based on two steps. It firstly uses a bridge between Arabic and other developed languages (English for occurrence) and then uses of the already developed features for that language. Hence those features apply not on the Arabic text but instead on the translated (the English) one. In some cases, the result needs to be in Arabic, in which case, we use the bridge another time to translate English result into Arabic. This can either be used in real NLP systems, such as Translation, IR, QA, Sentiment Analysis, or for validation or comparison purposes, especially for those who work in NLP and use other approaches. Experiments have been performed on a prototype we developed and the results obtained are satisfactory for this first version.",

Predicting and detecting early-stage depression using machine learning (ML) techniques is a promising strategy. This study’s main purpose is to assess which ML techniques are highly appropriate and accurate regarding such diagnoses. Six supervised ML techniques namely: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) were applied on dataset collected from Kaggle and compared for their accuracy (ACC) and performance in predicting depression. The performance of each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of ACC, F1-score, Precision (PR), and Sensitivity (SEN). Based on the experimental results analysis, we can conclude that SVM and LR performed better than all other methods with an ACC of 83,32%. Therefore, we found that a simple ML algorithm can be used to assist clinicians and practitioners predict depression at an early stage, with excellent potential utility and a considerable degree of ACC.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, the database field has gotten much more diverse, and as a result, a variety of non-relational (NoSQL) databases have been created, including JSON-document databases and key-value stores, as well as extensible markup language (XML) and graph databases. Due to the emergence of a new generation of data services, some of the problems associated with big data have been resolved. In addition, in the haste to address the challenges of big data, NoSQL abandoned several core databases features that make them extremely efficient and functional, for instance the global view, which enables users to access data regardless of how it is logically structured or physically stored in its sources. In this article, we propose a method that allows us to query non-relational databases based on the ontology-based access data (OBDA) framework by delegating SPARQL protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) queries from ontology to the NoSQL database. We applied the method on a popular database called Couchbase and we discussed the result obtained.",

    "Title": "A highly scalable CF recommendation system using ontology and SVD-based incremental approach",
    "Abstract": "In recent years, the need of recommender systems has increased to enhance user engagement, provide personalized services, and increase revenue, especially in the online shopping industry where vast amounts of customer data are generated. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used and effective approach for generating appropriate recommendations. However, the current CF approach has limitations in addressing common recommendation problems such as data inaccuracy recommendations, sparsity, scalability, and significant errors in prediction. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid CF method for movie recommendations that combines the incremental singular value decomposition approach with an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach in two phases, online and offline. The ontology-based technique is leveraged to enhance the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. Evaluating our method on a real-world movie recommendation dataset using precision, F1 scores, and mean absolute error (MAE) demonstrates that our system generates accurate predictions while addressing sparsity and scalability issues in recommendation system. Additionally, our method has the advantage of reduced running time.",

    "Title": "Enhancing Recommendation System using Ontology-based Similarity and Incremental SVD Prediction",
    "Abstract": "Background: With the explosion of data in recent years, recommender systems have become increasingly important for personalized services and enhancing user engagement in various industries, including e-commerce and entertainment. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely used approach for generating recommendations, but it has limitations in addressing issues such as sparsity, scalability, and prediction errors. Methods: To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid CF method for movie recommendations that combines an incremental singular value decomposition approach with an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach in both online and offline phases. The ontology-based technique improves the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world movie recommendation dataset using several performance metrics, including precision, F1 scores, and MAE. Results: The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy while also addressing sparsity and scalability issues in recommender systems. Additionally, our approach has the advantage of reduced running time, making it a promising solution for practical applications. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a promising solution to the challenges faced by traditional CF methods in recommender systems. By combining incremental SVD and ontological semantic filtering, the proposed method not only improves the accuracy of predictions and recommendations but also addresses issues related to scalability and sparsity. Overall, the proposed method has the potential to contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient recommendation systems in various industries, including e-commerce and entertainment.",

    "Title": "Roadmap for an Arabic Controlled Language",
    "Abstract": "Controlled Natural Languages or CNLs are artificial subsets of natural languages that aim to make communication clearer and more precise. In general, CNLs are used in communication between humans or with computers and, particularly, when clarity and unambiguity are required. Existing CNLs have been developed to be exploited in many applications such as technical documentation, machine translation or database query language. So far, many CNLs have been developed for Western languages, especially English, but no concrete CNL has yet been proposed for Arabic even with the increasing number of Arabic Internet users in the last two decades. In this paper, we propose a roadmap for developing an Arabic CNL to provide new kind and advanced natural language services for Arabic people. Methodologically speaking, we review the most important existing CNLs in English and other languages helping us knowing some statistics related to the vocabulary size and the number of grammar rules that could help in designing the new CNL. This paper proposes two major approaches; one relies on leveraging on already-built CNLs, whereas the other consists in starting from scratch. The survey of Arabic NLP challenges along the available resources and tools allowed us to favor the second approach as the basis for the proposed roadmap.",

    "Title": "ERABQS: entity resolution based on active machine learning and balancing query strategy",
    "Abstract": "Entity Resolution (ER) is a crucial process in the field of data management and integration. The primary goal of ER is to identify different profiles (or records) that refer to the same real-world entity across databases. The challenging problem is that labeling a large sample of profiles can be very expensive and time-consuming. Active Machine Learning (ActiveML) addresses this issue by selecting the most representative or informative profiles pairs to be labeled. The informativeness is determined by the capacity to diminish the uncertainty of the model. Conversely, representativeness evaluates whether a selected instance effectively reflects the overall input patterns of unlabeled data. Traditional ActiveML techniques typically rely on one strategy, Which may severely restrict the performance of the ActiveML process and lead to slow convergence. Especially in ER problems with a lack of initial training data. In this paper, we overcame this issue by inventing an approach for balancing the two above strategies. The implemented solution named EBEES (Epsilon-based Balancing Exploration and Exploitation Strategy), Which contains two variations: Adaptive-ϵ and ϵ-decreasing. We evaluated the EBEES on twelve datasets. Comparing the EBEES strategy against the state-of-the-art methods, without an initial training data, showed an enhanced performance in terms of F1-score, model stability, and rapid convergence.",

Due to their small size and cost-effective, WSN are attracting many industries to use them in various applications. Environmental monitoring, security of buildings and precision agriculture are few example among several other fields. However, WSN faces high security threats considering most of them are deployed in unattended nature and hostile environment. In the aim of providing secure data processing in the WSN, many techniques are proposed to protect the data privacy while being transferred from the sensors to the base station. This work is focusing on attack detection which is an essential task to secure the network and the data.

    "Title": "Enhancing OLSR Protocol by an Advanced Greedy Forwarding Mechanism for VANET in Smart Cities",
    "Abstract": "The future Intelligent Transport System \"ITS\" is one of the major challenges of the smart city. It requires fast and efficient communication between vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle “V2V”), to ensure information exchange in order to improve safety, which reduces accidents and consequently save lives, hence the need of the Vehicular Ad Hoc Network “VANET”, which makes possible the inter-vehicle communication. This network is characterized by a variable topology. Therefore, MANET (Mobile Adhoc NETwork) routing protocols need a few tweaks to be available for the vehicle environment. In this paper, we start by exposing some works related to the evaluation of the most well-known protocols. After a comparative study, we deduce that the OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) protocol outperforms other routing protocols in terms of End-to-End Delay (EED) and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). In addition, we note that the Greedy forwarding “GF” mechanism is suited for the VANET environment, which has been improved and called Greedy forwarding Advanced “GFA”, to overcome the stationary node problem. Our approach improves the OLSR protocol to be more suitable and efficient for VANET by introducing the GFA mechanism. Moreover, we compare our approach to the OLSR classic version. In this work, we use a realistic scenario from Open Street Map (OSM), and simulations are performed using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility). The trace files generated from SUMO are used for further simulation in NS-3 (Network Simulator) to validate our proposition. The simulation results are analyzed and discussed. Our approach performs best compared to OLSR in terms of EED and PDR, especially for dense traffic.",

    "Abstract": "Due to the rapid growth in technologies and services. the development of sensor nodes has imposed great challenges for researchers in improving our daily life in all domains such as environmental research. health care. monitoring. military. and physical activity recording. A wireless sensor network 'WSN) is therefore a collection of a small and large number of sensor nodes able of collecting. communicating with each other. and transmitting the collected data to a base station. For analyzing the performance of a WSN. different algorithms were developed and used. and the Hierarchical Geographic Adaptive Fidelity 'HGAF) is one of the most popular energy-efficient routing protocols. The decrease in energy use in the wireless sensor network directly affects the life of the network. HGAF is one of the important multiple locations based on the routing system algorithm. its main function technique is to deactivate unnecessary nodes from the network without interrupting the other connected nodes. In this article. we have proposed a technique known as Modified Geographic Adaptive Fidelity 'M.HGAF) protocol and its design as a power-saving meth-od. In our proposed technique. the size of the cell structure of the grid has changed and the communication method improves due to these changes. According to our results. the proposed technique increased the dead node rate by about 25%. which improved the network lifetime.",

    "Abstract": "Classical image deconvolution seeks an estimate of the true image when the blur kernel or the point spread function (PSF) of the blurring system is known a priori. However, blind image deconvolution addresses the much more complicated, but realistic problem where the PSF is unknown. Bayesian inference approach with appropriate priors on the image and the blur has been used successfully to solve this blind problem, in particular with a Gaussian prior and a joint maximum a posteriori (JMAP) estimation. However, this technique is unstable and suffers from significant ringing artifacts in various applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose a regularized version using H1 regularization terms on both the sharp image and the blur kernel. We present also useful techniques for estimating the smoothing parameters.

    "Abstract": "A wireless sensor network (WSN) is composed of a large number of sensor nodes that are insufficient in terms of processing power, storage, and energy. The principal tasks of nodes are gathering and transmitting data collected to the base station (BS). Consequently, the essential criteria for designing a WSN are the network lifetime. In this paper, we proposed an efficient geographic adaptative fidelity (GAF) routing protocol for gathering data. In this system, sensor nodes are distributed using Gaussian law, and an active leader is elected for each virtual grid to reduce the energy dissipated. An optimized weighted sum model is used to resolve this problem, where the maximum remaining energy and minimum distance criteria are considered as essential criteria. Moreover, routing data focuses on the transmission range for enhancing energy efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed energy-efficient GAF produces better performance than the existing, GAF basic and optimized-GAF routing protocol in terms of the number of dead nodes and energy consumption. It is obviously proved that the proposed efficient GAF can improve the network's lifetime.",

The truncated nuclear norm has been known as a powerful low-rank approach both for the matrix and the tensor cases. However, the low-rank approaches are unable to characterize some additional information exhibited in data such as the smoothness or feature-preserving properties. In this work, a tensor completion model based on the convex truncated nuclear norm and the nonconvex-sparse total variation is introduced.

The regularized deblurring problem, which is mathematically given by the sum of a fidelity term and a regularization term, is decoupled into an observation fidelity and a denoiser model steps. One basic advantage of the iterative decoupling algorithm is that the deblurring problem is supervised by the efficiency of the denoiser model. Thus, we consider a patch-based weighted low-rank tensor with sparsity prior. Numerical tests to image deblurring are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed decoupling based algorithm.",

    "Title": "Enhanced GAF protocol based on graph theory to optimize energy efficiency and lifetime in WSN technology",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to design an enhanced routing protocol to minimize energy consumed and extend network lifetime in sensor network (WSN). Design/methodology/approach: With the use of appropriate routing protocols, data collected by sensor nodes reache the BS. The entire network lifetime can be extended well beyond that of its single nodes by putting the nodes in sleep state when they are not in use, and make active just a single node at a time within a given area of interest. So that, the lowest-cost routing arises by minimizing the communication cost. This paper proposes an enhanced adaptive geographic fidelity (E-GAF) routing protocol based on theory of graphs approach to improve the discovery phase, select the optimal path, reduce the energy used by nodes and therefore extend the network lifetime. Following the simulations established by varying the number of grids and tests, a comparison is made between the E-GAF and basic GAF (B-GAF) based on the number of dead nodes and energy consumption. Findings: The results obtained show that E-GAF is better than the existing basic GAF protocol in terms of energy efficiency and network lifetime. Originality/value: This paper adopts the latest optimization algorithm know as E-GAF, which is used to solve the problem of energy and improve the network lifetime in a WSN. This is the first work that utilizes network lifetime in WSN.",

Especially, for medical images that contain significant details and characteristics. In this work, the authors are interested in this unsupervised learning technique for discovering and visualising the underlying structure of a medical image. Therefore, an adaptive bi-dictionary learning model for recovering magnetic resonance (MR) image from undersampled measurements is introduced. The proposed model learns two dictionaries, one over the underlying image and the other over its sparse gradient. Hence, the algorithm minimises a linear combination of three terms corresponding to the least-squares data fitting, dictionary learning over the pixel domain, and gradient-based dictionary. Numerically, experimental results on several MR images demonstrate that the proposed bi-dictionary framework can improve reconstruction accuracy over other methods.",

This work improved the inter-cluster communication by the use of a strong network classification. Moreover, it aims at routing data using an optimal routing path based on the graph theory model.

The upper-level directly addresses the completion problem with the truncated nuclear norm, while the lower-level uses the sparsity prior which is characterized by the l1-norm for the denoising task. Furthermore, we propose a simple strategy to solve our bilevel optimization problem. It formulates the lower-level as a fixed-point equation and then applies a simple but efficient iterative algorithm to get the reconstructed tensor. Numerically, the superiority of the proposal is reported via several experiments conducted on real data with an extremely small subset of observed entries.",

The temperature of the right sidewall is maintained relatively cold, while the unheated portions of the left wall and the horizontal ones are thermally insulated. The governing differential equations are numerically solved using a finite volume technique based on the iterative Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equation (SIMPLE) algorithm. The objective of this article is to analyze the impacts of the Rayleigh number, the Pearson number, the power-law index, and the location and length of the heat source on the fluid structure and temperature patterns, and to subtract the impact of these control parameters on the cooling efficiency of the cavity. The results reveal that rising the heater size and the Rayleigh number improves free convection inside the cavity. Moreover, using shear-thinning fluids (i.e. n < 1) with high value of the Pearson number enhances the thermal performance of the enclosure. The findings also point to the existence of a peak in the average Nusselt number variation, corresponding to an optimal heater location.",

    "Title": "Smooth tensor robust principal component analysis with application to color image recovery",
    "Abstract": "In this work, we study the problem of tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). The core idea is to decompose a given tensor into the superposition of a low-rank and sparse tensor and to recover each component individually. The key to the TRPCA approach is to efficiently characterize the low-rankness of the underlying tensor. Recently, the tensor train rank (TT) based on an augmentation technique, which transforms a lower-order tensor to a higher-order one, has successfully been used to characterize the low-rankness prior. However, the TT rank-based augmentation technique leads to visible block artifacts. Moreover, using only the TT rank may generally be insufficient to capture local information in data. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a novel model for the TRPCA model based on an edge-preserving smoothing prior to recover a low-rank tensor corrupted by sparse noise. The proposed model is named smooth-TRPCA. On the theoretical side, we adapt the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the minimization problem. The superiority of our model is numerically reported via several experiments conducted on colors images.",

    "Title": "Parallel matrix factorization-based collaborative sparsity and smooth prior for estimating missing values in multidimensional data",
    "Abstract": "Parallel matrix factorization has recently emerged as a powerful tool for low-rank tensor recovery problems. However, using only the low-rank property is often not sufficient for recovering valuable details in images. Generally, incorporating additional prior knowledge shows significant improvement in the recovered results. Therefore, smooth matrix factorization has been introduced for tensor completion in which the smoothness of its spectral factor over the third mode has been recently considered. However, these models may not efficiently characterize the smoothness of the target tensor. Thus, in this work, we are interested in boosting the piecewise smoothness by using the third-mode smoothness of the underlying tensor combined with spectral sparsity of the third factor of the factorization. Therefore, we propose in this paper a parallel matrix factorization-based sparsity constraint with a smoothness prior to the third mode of the target tensor. We develop a multi-block proximal alternating minimization algorithm for solving the proposed model. Theoretically, we show that the generated sequence globally converges to a critical point. The superiority of our model over other tensor completion methods in terms of several evaluation metrics is reported via extensive experiments conducted on real data such as videos, hyperspectral images, and MRI data.",

Although fluid registration approaches have succeeded in handling large image deformations, the numerical results are sometimes inconsistent and unexpected. This is related, in fact, to the used numerical scheme which does not take into consideration the different properties of the continuous operators. To take into account these properties, we use a robust numerical scheme based on finite volume with pressure correction. This scheme, which is called by the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equation-Consistent (SIMPLEC), is known for its stability and consistency in fluid dynamics context. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient and stable, visually and quantitatively, compared to some classical registration methods.",

    "Abstract": "Image denoising plays an important role in image processing, which aims to separate clean images from noisy images. A number of methods have been presented to deal with this practical problem over the past several years. The best currently available wavelet-based denoising methods take advantage of the merits of the wavelet transform. Most of these methods, however, still have difficulties in defining the threshold parameter which can limit their capability. In this paper, we propose a novel wavelet denoising approach based on unsupervised learning model. The approach taken aims at exploiting the merits of the wavelet transform: sparsity, multi-resolution structure, and similarity with the human visual system, to adapt an unsupervised dictionary learning algorithm for creating a dictionary devoted to noise reduction. Using the K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm, we obtain an adaptive dictionary by learning over the wavelet decomposition of the noisy image. Experimental results on benchmark test images show that our proposed method achieves very competitive denoising performance and outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods, especially in the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity (SSIM) index, and visual effects with different noise levels.",

    "Title": "Pattern-Based Recommender System Using Nuclear Norm Minimization of Three-Mode Tensor and Quantum Fidelity-Based K -Means",
    "Abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) consist of predicting missing ratings based on the observed ones. This problem corresponds to matrix completion where users are its rows and items are its columns and it contains the observed ratings. An efficient RS is the one promoting the personal relevancy of its users which is not the case in the matrix completion process. It takes into account all the rates for prediction without including the users' and items' characteristics. Patterns are the key enablers of such solutions. In this work, we present a three-mode tensor representation with two aspects namely user-item interactions (observed ratings) and item-item relationship (detected similarities). To capture the similarities, the patterns are grouped in an equivalent manner using a bi-quantum clustering process (Quantum K-means). This step is adopted to consider only the relevant observed ratings in the prediction process and express item-to-item relationship using fidelity distance. Then, for each missing rating r that a user u might give to an item i in the future, a sub-tensor is created according to the detected patterns. This sub-tensor then is completed by minimizing its rank. This problem is NP-hard, hence a surrogate is used which is the nuclear norm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is measured according to information retrieval evaluation criteria: precision, recall and F1-measure. The proposed approach improved the precision of the state-of-the-art methods by 20%.",

In this article, we propose a new better-performing recommender system that operates as a combination of an adapted quantum K-means algorithm and the singular value decomposition (SVT) algorithm. We integrate the developed quantum clustering algorithm to a prediction process of the proposed recommender system using matrix completion. To the best of our knowledge, no system with such details was proposed in the literature. The system was applied on the MovieLens dataset without a dimensionality reduction step and evaluated according to measures of information retrieval systems. The results of the quantum K-means algorithm show that the quantum version leads to a logarithmic reduction of the time complexity compared to the classical algorithm. The proposed system has proved to be better than the previous tested ones in terms of precision and recall.",

    "Abstract": "The simulation of non-Newtonian fluids is a challenging task from theoretical and numerical points of view. Different numerical methods has been used to study this class of fluids. In this article, a novel numerical scheme based on lattice Boltzmann method is presented for the simulation of White–Metzner (WM) fluid flows, where two types of distribution functions are defined for the evolution of momentum and stress, respectively. We study the accuracy, and the influence of different parameters on the flow on different benchmarks: we validate our model first for a two-dimensional planar channel, and then we investigate in details the behavior of WM fluid flows in a square lid driven cavity. In the numerical results, we give a very detailed investigation to elaborate the effect over a large range of each parameter on the flow field.",

    "Title": "Helicopter main rotor fault diagnosis by using GA-and PSO-based classifiers",
    "Abstract": "This paper presents an improvement in the recognition of faulty signals, encountered in the case of the Gazelle helicopter's main rotor, using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods. The main focus is on the distinction between faulty and healthy signals and then between the three subclasses of faulty signals, i.e. faulty bearings, joints problem and mechanical loosening. This research work is divided into three parts. The first part approaches the two above-mentioned classes of signals at the same time, and, to this purpose, the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Non Linear Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) and Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) are used. In the second and third part of the paper, GA and PSO are employed for optimizing the hyperplanes and hypersurfaces which separate the above-mentioned classes of signals, as well as the architecture and connection weights of a neural network (NN). Real data are used, which correspond to the vibration signals measured during periodic technical inspections, and are characterized by amplitudes and frequencies typical of the eight highest peaks of the Welch spectrum. The results obtained confirm the validity of the above-mentioned approaches and comparable favorably with those of other multivariate methods. The GA-or PSO-based neural networks diagnosis can therefore be established for helicopter computers so that faults can be detected.",

    "Title": "Moving towards smart cities: A selection of middleware for fog-to-cloud services",
    "Abstract": "Smart cities aim at integrating various IoT (Internet of Things) technologies by providing many opportunities for the development, governance, and management of user services. One of the ways to support this idea is to use cloud and edge computing techniques to reduce costs, manage resource consumption, enhance performance, and connect the IoT devices more effectively. However, the selection of services remains a significant research question since there are currently different strategies towards cloud computing, including services for central remote computing (traditional cloud model) as well as distributed local computing (edge computing). In this paper, we offer an integrated view of these two directions and the selection among the edge technologies based on MCDA (Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) algorithms. To this end, we propose a foglet as a middleware that aims at achieving satisfactory levels of customer services by using fuzzy similarity and TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) to facilitate the rating and selection of services in the fog-to-cloud environment. Then, we describe the selection process with a numerical example, and conclude our work with an outline of future perspectives.",

In this paper, we focus on developing the mathematical learning skills of braille users with a new assistive technology developed to retrieve semantically mathematical information from the web. This kind of research is still in the study phase. This paper presents an overview of assistive technologies for braille users followed by a description of the proposed system, which works in four phases. In the first phase, we translate a query math formula in braille into MathML code, and then we extract the structural and semantic meaning from the MathML expressions using multilevel presentation. In the classification phase, we choose a multilevel similarity measure based on K-Nearest Neighbors to evaluate the relevance between expressions. Finally, the query result is converted to braille math expressions. Experiments based on our database show that the new system provides more efficient results in responding to user queries.",

Existing NLIs work mostly with the English language. There are very few attempts to develop systems supporting the Arabic language. In this paper, we propose a portable NLI to Arabic ontologies; it will transform the user's query expressed in Arabic into formal language query. The proposed system starts by a preparation phase that creates a gazetteer from the given ontology. The issued query is then processed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract keywords. These keywords are mapped to the ontology entities, then a valid SPARQL query is generated based on the ontology definition and the reasoning capabilities of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). To evaluate our tool we used two different Arabic ontologies: a Qur'anic ontology and an Arabic sample of Mooney Geography dataset. The proposed system achieved 64% recall and 76% precision.",

    "Title": "Hybridization of fuzzy and hard semi-supervised clustering algorithms tuned with ant lion optimizer applied to Higgs Boson Search",
    "Abstract": "This paper focuses on the unsupervised detection of the Higgs boson particle using the most informative features and variables which characterize the “Higgs machine learning challenge 2014” data set. This unsupervised detection goes in this paper analysis through 4 steps: (1) selection of the most informative features from the considered data; (2) definition of the number of clusters based on the elbow criterion. The experimental results showed that the optimal number of clusters that group the considered data in an unsupervised manner corresponds to 2 clusters; (3) proposition of a new approach for hybridization of both hard and fuzzy clustering tuned with Ant Lion Optimization (ALO); (4) comparison with some existing metaheuristic optimizations such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By employing a multi-angle analysis based on the cluster validation indices, the confusion matrix, the efficiencies and purities rates, the average cost variation, the computational time and the Sammon mapping visualization, the results highlight the effectiveness of the improved Gustafson–Kessel algorithm optimized with ALO (ALOGK) to validate the proposed approach. Even if the paper gives a complete clustering analysis, its novel contribution concerns only the Steps (1) and (3) considered above. The first contribution lies in the method used for Step (1) to select the most informative features and variables. We used the t-Statistic technique to rank them. Afterwards, a feature mapping is applied using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to identify the level of correlation between them. Then, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a metaheuristic optimization technique, is used to reduce the data set dimension. The second contribution of this work concern the third step, where each one of the clustering algorithms as K-means (KM), Global K-means (GlobalKM), Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), Fuzzy C-means (FCM), Gustafson–Kessel (GK) and Gath–Geva (GG) is optimized and tuned with ALO.",

    "Title": "Multi-criteria decision analysis methods in the mobile cloud offloading paradigm",
    "Abstract": "Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is becoming a popular mobile technology that aims to augment local resources of mobile devices, such as energy, computing, and storage, by using available cloud services and functionalities. The offloading process is one of the techniques used in MCC to enhance the capabilities of mobile devices by moving mobile data and computation-intensive operations to cloud platforms. Several techniques have been proposed to perform and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the offloading process, such as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). MCDA is a well-known concept that aims to select the best solution among several alternatives by evaluating multiple conflicting criteria, explicitly in decision making. However, as there are a variety of platforms and technologies in mobile cloud computing, it is still challenging for the offloading process to reach a satisfactory quality of service from the perspective of customers’ computational service requests. Thus, in this paper, we conduct a literature review that leads to a better understanding of the usability of the MCDA methods in the offloading operation that is strongly reliant on the mobile environment, network operators, and cloud services. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of these MCDA techniques for offloading research in mobile cloud computing. Finally, we recommend a set of future research directions in MCDA used for the mobile cloud offloading process.",

    "Title": "A Heuristic Algorithm of Cooperative Agents Communication for Enhanced GAF Routing Protocol in WSNs",
    "Abstract": "Rapid progress in technologies has led to the development of small sensor nodes. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is an interconnected collection of a large number of these small sensor nodes that is used to monitor and record the physical environment. WSNs have applications in diverse scenarios. They play an important role in tracking and monitoring in different domains, such as environmental research, military, and health care. In most of these applications, the WSN is composed of a large number of nodes deployed in an area of interest, and not all nodes are directly connected to the base station (BS). In some cases, batteries of nodes cannot be recharged or changed. For that, the most solution required to overcome these problems is to optimize energy consumed during communication. Data transmission in networks is maintained by routing protocols, which are responsible for discovering the required paths. This paper presents an improvement of the Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) routing protocol created on a smart actives node selection. The routing process works on cooperative agents communication where another node is activated in the same grid if the data collected are considered as important data, and a heuristic method is used to find an optimal path in terms of energy to transmit data collected until reaching the BS. Simulation results prove that the cooperative agents GAF (CAGAF) routing protocol proposed is more efficient compared to the basic version in terms of considering important data, energy consumed, and dead nodes.",

    "Title": "Collaborating filtering using unsupervised learning for image reconstruction from missing data",
    "Abstract": "In the image acquisition process, important information in an image can be lost due to noise, occlusion, or even faulty image sensors. Therefore, we often have images with missing and/or corrupted pixels. In this work, we address the problem of image completion using a matrix completion approach that minimizes the nuclear norm to recover missing pixels in the image. The image matrix has a low rank. The proposed approach uses the nuclear norm function as a surrogate of the rank function in the aim to resolve the problem of rank minimization that is known as an NP-hard problem. It is an adaptation of the collaborating filtering approach used for users’ profile construction. The main advantage of this approach is that it uses a learning process to classify pixels into clusters and exploits them to run a predictive method in the aim to recover the missing or unknown data. For performance evaluation, the proposed approach and the existing matrix completion methods are compared for image reconstruction according to the PSNR measure. These methods are applied on a dataset composed of standard images used for image processing. All the recovered images obtained during experimentation are also dressed to compare them visually. Simulation results verify that the proposed approach achieves better performances than the existing matrix completion methods used for image reconstruction from missing data.",

    "Abstract": "Increasing the size of an image is an extensively studied problem in image processing. In recent years, many studies have been conducted on image super-resolution (SR). Since the super-resolution techniques depend on the motion precision estimation, we investigate the use of a nonlinear elastic (called hyperelastic) image registration. Also, we propose a spatially weighted second order SR algorithm, which takes into account the distribution of the spatial information in different image areas. The hyperelastic image registration is used to handle the subpixel errors between the unregistered images, while the spatially weighted second order regularization allows to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to degradation factors (blur and noise). As a result, the registration model is more efficient and easier to implement and the proposed SR algorithm reduces artifacts in flat regions of the image and also preserves well sharp edges. The efficiency of the proposed model is demonstrated using simulated and real tests, while comparison with other competitive SR methods is achieved.",

Indeed, the recognition of Arabic handwriting characters still catches the absence of a reference database of Arabic handwritten characters covering all forms of Arabic characters and all possible ligatures of the characters.

    "Title": "Fluid image registration using a finite volume scheme of the incompressible navier stokes equation",
    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a stable numerical implementation of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid image registration, based on a finite volume scheme. Although fluid registration methods have succeeded in handling large deformations in various applications, they still suffer from perturbed solutions due to the choice of the numerical implementation. Thus, a robust numerical scheme in the optimization step is required to enhance the quality of the registration. A key challenge is the use of a finite volume-based scheme, since we have to deal with a hyperbolic equation type. We propose the classical Patankar scheme based on pressure correction, which is called Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equation (SIMPLE). The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested on magnetic resonance images of the human brain and hands, and compared with the classical implementation of the fluid image registration [13], in which the authors used a successive overrelaxation in the spatial domain with Euler integration in time to handle the nonlinear viscous. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, visually and quantitatively, using the differences between images criteria, PSNR and SSIM measures.",

It has various applications such as health care, emergency situations, industrial applications and home automation. It has several challenges like security and quality of service. Sensor node has a limited energy related to its tiny battery. Hence, energy efficiency is considered as an important challenge in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). This paper aims at describing the various routing categories and the different efficient routing protocols. Along with this, a new enhanced version of the VLEACH protocol based on selecting the routing path efficiently is also proposed in this paper. The efficient selection process is based on electing the Cluster Heads (CHs) and the Vice-CH according to the highest residual energy. In addition, it uses a cooperative routing between the CHs and Vice-CHs in order to reduce the network energy consumption. Implementation of Basic VLEACH and Proposed VLEACH is done using NS-2 Simulator. Simulation results show that the new scheme is more efficient than the original VLEACH protocol. This protocol will increase the lifetime of sensor networks. So the proposed work can be applied in various WSNs which are deployed in remote areas and recharging of sensor nodes is an issue.",

It is hard to understand and interpret without consulting domain experts and specialized Qur’anic books. Therefore we believe that a system based on simple questions written in Arabic and capable of retrieving answers from the Qur’an would be of a great interest to all those who want to study the Qur’an. In recent years, a number of researches have been conducted to facilitate the retrieval of knowledge from the Qur’an; however, most of the available researches are based on keyword search and do not rely on semantics. Building a semantic-based system has a number of challenges such as the lack of resources for the Arabic language and the difficulty to model the content of the Qur’an by fear of altering its right meaning. In this paper, we introduce a semantic-based search engine for the Qur’an, it is based on creating an ontology that represents the Qur’an knowledge in Web Ontology Language format, and a natural language interface that transforms user queries expressed in Arabic into SPARQL queries and then retrieves answers from the ontology.",

The main goal of our approach consists of the derivation and the use of an efficient combined deblurring and denoising stage that is applied on the high-resolution image. We demonstrate the existence of minimizers of the combined variational problem in the bounded variation space, and we propose a minimization algorithm. The numerical results obtained by our approach are compared with the classical robust super-resolution (RSR) algorithm and the SR with TV regularization.

    "Abstract": "Systems of data integration using ontologies aim to implement a collaborative environment between sources for sharing data and services to respond a user request for information. Their users' requests are an exact expression of their needs. However, the multiplicity of data sources, their scalability and the increasing difficulty to control their descriptions and their contents are the reasons behind the implacability of this assumption today. The users now may not know the data sources they questioned, nor their description or content. Consequently, their queries reflect no more a need that must be satisfied but an intention that must be refined according to data sources available at the time of interrogation. In this work, we present a semantic-based approach to enrich user' queries expressed in SPARQL Language by his preferences in order to adapt the returned results and make them more precise and more relevant. The proposed approach is applied on a movies management system based on the standard MovieLens dataset. The obtained results are compared to existing approaches according to precision and recall measures. Our approach improved the precision with 26% and the recall with 7% comparing to those of previous study using collaborative filtering.",

    "Title": "Semantic Trajectory Knowledge Discovery: A Promising Way to Extract Meaningful Patterns from Spatiotemporal Data",
    "Abstract": "Spatiotemporal data mining studies the field of discovering interesting patterns from large spatiotemporal databases. Although these databases generate a huge volume of data daily from satellite images and mobile sensors like GPS, among these data we find first spatiotemporal and geographical data; secondly, the trajectories browsed by moving objects in some time intervals. Combination of these types of data leads to producing semantic trajectory data. Enriching trajectories with semantic geographical information leads to ease queries, analysis, and mining, in order to give more meaning to behaviors potentially extracted from trajectories. Therefore, applying mining techniques on semantic trajectories continue to prove to be a success story in discovering useful and nontrivial behavioral patterns of moving objects. The purpose of this paper is to make an overview of spatiotemporal knowledge discovery (STKD) and techniques recently used to extract knowledge from spatiotemporal data based on analysis of recent literature. Then leading towards a deeper analysis about semantic trajectory knowledge discovery as a specified field from STKD that integrates trajectory sample points with geographical data before applying mining techniques in order to extract behavioral knowledge from semantic trajectories which can be more useful and significant for the application users.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a new approach of super-resolution. Since almost all super-resolution problems suffer from the motion and blur estimations, new techniques are considered to improve the registration and restoration steps. The proposed method consists of a non parametric registration based on diffusion regularisation and a total variation restoration in the reconstitution step, since super-resolution reconstruction is actually an ill-posed problem. We consider that the deformation is not parametric and differs from one image to another. We also prove the existence of a solution to the two well posed problems (registration and debluring). Simulation results show the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm against small deformations compared to other existing methods.",

    "Title": "A multi-frame super-resolution using diffusion registration and a nonlocal variational image restoration",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a new approach of multi-frame super-resolution (SR). The SR techniques strongly depend on the availability of accurate motion estimation. When the estimation of motion is not well established, as usually happens for non-parametric motion, annoying artifacts appear in the super-resolved image. Since SR problems suffer from the motion and blur estimations, new techniques are considered to improve the registration and restoration steps. The proposed method consists of a non-parametric image registration based on diffusion regularization and a nonlocal Laplace regularizer combined with a bilateral filter (BTV) in the reconstruction step to remove noise and motion outliers. The diffusion registration is employed to handle the small deformation between the unregistered images, while the combination of nonlocal Laplace and BTV is used to increase the robustness of the restoration step with respect to the blurring effect and to the noise. We also prove the existence of a solution to the well posed registration problem. Simulation results using different images show the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm against noise and outliers compared to other existing methods.",

    "Title": "A new method for the extraction of fetal ECG from the dependent abdominal signals using blind source separation and adaptive noise cancellation techniques",
    "Abstract": "Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that records the electrical activity of the heart, and depicts it as a series of graph-like tracings, or waves. Being able to interpret these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart problems. Fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) extraction has an important impact in medical diagnostics during the mother pregnancy period. Since the observed FECG signals are often mixed with the maternal ECG (MECG) and the noise induced by the movement of electrodes or by mother motion, the separation process of the ECG signal sources from the observed data becomes quite complicated. One of its complexity is when the ECG sources are dependent, thus, in this paper we introduce a new approach of blind source separation (BSS) in the noisy context for both independent and dependent ECG signal source. This approach consist in denoising the observed ECG signals using a bilateral total variation (BTV) filter; then minimizing the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the FECG signal from the MECG one. Results: We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our proposed method. We will consider many examples of independent/dependent source component signals. The results will be compared with those of the classical method called independent component analysis (ICA) under the same conditions. The accuracy of source estimation is evaluated through a criterion, called again the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The first experiment shows that our proposed method gives accurate estimation of sources in the standard case of independent components, with performance around 27 dB in term of SNR. In the second experiment, we show the capability of the proposed algorithm to successfully separate two noisy mixtures of dependent source components - with classical criterion devoted to the independent case - fails, and that our method is able to deal with the dependent case with good performance. Conclusions: In this work, we focus specifically on the separation of the ECG signal sources taken from skin two electrodes located on a pregnant woman's body. The ECG separation is interpreted as a noisy linear BSS problem with instantaneous mixtures. Firstly, a denoising step is required to reduce the noise due to motion artifacts using a BTV filter as a very effective one-pass filter for denoising. Then, we use the Kullbak-Leibler divergence between copula densities to separate the fetal heart rate from the mother one, for both independent and dependent cases.",

    "Title": "An iterative image super-resolution approach based on Bregman distance",
    "Abstract": "The aim of super-resolution (SR) algorithms is to recover high-resolution (HR) images and videos from low-resolution (LR) ones. Since the SR is considered as an ill-posed minimization problem, regularization techniques are then considered. The choice of the regularization term plays a major role in the quality of the obtained HR image. Even if many terms have been proposed in the literature, they still suffer from different undesirable artifacts. To address these weaknesses, we propose a variational SR model based on Huber-Norm using Bregman distances. This offers the new model to be more consistent against contrast loss and smoothing gray values, in contrast, strong edges and contours are well preserved in the reconstruct HR image. Moreover, the use of first-order primal–dual algorithm with an adaptive regularization parameter choice assure the convergence to the desired HR image, in a fast way, preserving important image features. As a result, the proposed algorithm shows promising results for various real and synthetic datasets compared with other methods.",

In addition, the growing demand for access to data and information from human users on the go has created the need for advanced vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle to roadside communication systems capable of high data rates and amenable to high degrees of node mobility. The importance of inter-vehicle communication is increasing due to its role in organizing road. In this paper we present our proposition witch consisting of a new routing protocol VANET (vehicle AdHoc Network). This protocol is based on the localization of the node, and also the score assigned to each vehicle and the cost for each junction. We evaluate the performance of our protocol IRUV by comparing it with the VANET protocols: LAR and GyTAR in terms of: End to End Delay, and Delivery Ratio. To demonstrate the performance of our proposal, we used a traffic simulator VanetMobiSim to generate a realistic traffic. The trace of this traffic will be integrated into the simulation of the proposed protocol using the network simulator NS2. © Rinton Press.",

    "Abstract": "Two-dimensional steady laminar natural convection of a viscoelastic fluid represented by generalized second-grade fluid model in a square enclosure is studied. The cavity is submitted at its vertical sides to a uniform density of heat flux while the horizontal walls are insulated, without slipping conditions at all the solid boundaries. The governing conservation and constitutive equations with the corresponding boundary conditions are solved by finite volume method in a collocated grid system. The contributions of shear rate dependent and elastic characteristics of the viscoelastic fluid are investigated on momentum and heat transport. The effects of elastic number (E) in the range 0 - 1 on heat transfer and fluid motion are interpreted for a power-law index (n) in the range 1.4 - 0.6 and nominal values of Rayleigh number (Ra) range of 103 to 105.",

    "Title": "Finite volume multigrid method of the planar contraction flow of a viscoelastic fluid",
    "Abstract": "This paper reports on a numerical algorithm for the steady flow of viscoelastic fluid. The conservative and constitutive equations are solved using the finite volume method (FVM) with a hybrid scheme for the velocities and first-order upwind approximation for the viscoelastic stress. A non-uniform staggered grid system is used. The iterative SIMPLE algorithm is employed to relax the coupled momentum and continuity equations. The non-linear algebraic equations over the flow domain are solved iteratively by the symmetrical coupled Gauss-Seidel (SCGS) method. In both, the full approximation storage (FAS) multigrid algorithm is used. An Oldroyd-B fluid model was selected for the calculation. Results are reported for planar 4:1 abrupt contraction at various Weissenberg numbers. The solutions are found to be stable and smooth. The solutions show that at high Weissenberg number the domain must be long enough. The convergence of the method has been verified with grid refinement. All the calculations have been performed on a PC equipped with a Pentium III processor at 550 MHz. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "This work deals with the numerical simulation on an unstructured mesh of the ignition and burning in an oxidizing atmosphere of a fuel droplet heated on one side. This is relevant for studying the ignition of droplets in a spray when they are crossing a flame zone stabilized in it. The droplet here is replaced by a porous cylinder, and the flame by a hot solid wall. The reaction is assumed to be described by a single step, A + vB → P. The cell-centred finite volume scheme considered here uses a generalized Roe's approximate Riemann solver with the monotonic upwind scheme for conservative laws (MUSCL) technique for the convective part and Green-Gauss type interpolation for the viscous part. The thinness of the reaction zone is taken into account by using an adaptive refinement-unrefinement procedure. It has been found that the process of droplet ignition takes place by means of a propagation of a triple flame around the 'droplet' when the chemical reaction is sufficiently fast with respect to the molecular heat and mass diffusion process. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Traditionally, cloud computing has been used as the preferred platform for aggregating, processing, and analyzing IoT traffic. However, the cloud may not be the preferred platform for IoT devices in terms of responsiveness and immediate processing and analysis of IoT data and requests. For this reason, fog or edge computing has emerged to overcome such problems, whereby fog nodes are placed in close proximity to IoT devices. Fog nodes are primarily responsible of the local aggregation, processing, and analysis of IoT workload, thereby resulting in significant notable performance and responsiveness. One of the open issues and challenges in the area of fog computing is efficient scalability in which a minimal number of fog nodes are allocated based on the IoT workload and such that the SLA and QoS …",

Virtual machine consolidation remains the most deployed strategy to manage both performance and energy consumption. Most of existing energy efficiency techniques save energy against the cost on performance degradation. Consolidation techniques leverage thresholds to detect overloaded and underloaded hosts that could be vacated to achieve optimal balance between host utilization and energy consumption. In this research, we propose an energy-efficient strategy (EES) to consolidate virtual machines in cloud environment with an aim of reducing the energy consumption while completing more tasks with the highest throughput.

    "Abstract": "One of the major challenges in the next generation networks is maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS) for different users who use the services of such a technology. The problem increases when the flows that traverse the wireless link belong to classes with different requirements of QoS. In this case, the network services face several disadvantages caused by the unreliability of wireless channel and the channel sharing by several users. In this paper, we consider a single-cell IEEE 802.16 e environment in which the base station allocates subchannels to the subscriber stations in its coverage area. Therefore, two systems are compared. In the first system, called system without Feedback Control, for each uplink subchannel, a separate single queue is used for buffering the VoIP packets from Subscriber Station (SS) to Base Station (BS). However, in the second system, called system with Feedback Control, an Active Queue Managment (AQM) is used to control the VoIP packets. Two thresholds are used in the queue in an effort to control the arrival rate of the VoIP packets. The VoIP arrivals are modeled by a two-state Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) process. A queuing analytical model is presented to evaluate the performance of both systems. Numerical results obtained show the positive impact of the AQM added to the second system on the performance parameters of VoIP packets compared to the first system.",

The Existing techniques are inefficient and have real-time detection issues and are also very data hypersensitive, therefore, they can be circumvented by the attackers. The main problem this article addresses is how to automatically detect DGA in a way that does not rely solely on reverse engineering, not strongly affected by data size, and allows detection of this DGA in real time. This paper presents DTFS-DGA model that combine neural networks models with traditional machine learning models and maintains its performance even if the data size changes to detect DGA in real time. The model …",

    "Abstract": "In a democratic regime, voting is crucial to making collective decisions. Unfortunately, although this activity has great significance and value, little effort has been made to improve the way we vote. Paper ballots are still the most used method, although this method is relatively simple, brings many inconveniences, and represents a contradiction to the modern world and its advances. This paper mostly focuses on a review study of blockchain‐based voting systems. It aims at identifying the strategies and the guidelines as well as provides a comprehensive end‐to‐end electronic voting system based on blockchain, with the help of cryptographic techniques such as zero‐knowledge proofs to improve privacy. The novelty of this paper is that we tackle the limitations of electronic voting systems found in the literature, including cost, identity management, and scalability problems.

    "Title": "Unsupervised Clustering for a Comparative Methodology of Machine Learning Models to Detect Domain-Generated Algorithms Based on an Alphanumeric Features Analysis",
    "Abstract": "Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are often used for generating huge amounts of domain names to maintain command and control between the infected computer and the bot master. By establishing as needed a great number of domain names, attackers may mask their C2 servers and escape detection. Many malware families have switched to a stealthier contact approach. Therefore, the traditional methods become ineffective. Over the past decades, many researches have started to use artificial intelligence to create systems able to detect DGA in traffic, but these works do not use the same data to evaluate their models. This article proposes a comparative methodology to compare machine learning models based on unsupervised clustering and then applied this methodology to study the best models belonging to neural network methods and traditional machine learning methods to detect DGAs.

    "Abstract": "Virtual machine placement (VMP) is carried out during virtual machine migration to choose the best physical computer to host the virtual machines. It is a crucial task in cloud computing. It directly affects data center performance, resource utilization, and power consumption, and it can help cloud providers save money on data center maintenance. To optimize various characteristics that affect data centers, VMs, and their runs, numerous VMP strategies have been developed in the cloud computing environment. This paper aims to compare the accuracy and efficiency of nine distinct strategies for treating the VMP as a knapsack problem. In the numerical analysis, we test out various conditions to determine how well the system works. We first illustrate the rate of convergence for algorithms, then the rate of execution time growth for a given number of virtual machines, and lastly the rate of development of CPU usage rate …",

    "Abstract": "As a result of the dynamic nature of Virtual Machine allocation in cloud computing, it is not easy to manage system resources or choose the best configuration based solely on human experience. In this work, we used stochastic modelling instead of comprehensive experiments to evaluate the best resource management of the system. In such complex systems, choosing the best decision is a challenge, for this reason we have designed a heuristic algorithm, specifically, dynamic programming as a resource management and programming tool that finds a way that attempts to satisfy the conflicting objectives of high performance and low power consumption. As a scenario for using this algorithm, we addressed the problem of virtual machine allocation, a subset of physical machines is designated as\" reserve\", and the reserves are actives when the number of jobs in the system is sufficiently high. The question is how to decide when to activate the reserves. The simulation results demonstrated the benefit of using our framework to identify the policy for consolidation or for a low energy consumption and in order to have a good quality of service in the system.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) has the property to be formed dynamically by a system of mobile nodes which are connected via wireless links with no centralized administration. All nodes can be mobile resulting in a possibly dynamic network topology. Two of the major problems in this network are energy consumption and Quality of Service (QoS) related to traffic requirements. This paper aims to explore the performances of the combination of routing protocol and mobility model in terms of QoS relating to CBR traffic and to network lifetime. Hence, simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of AODV, DSR and DSDV routing protocols under various mobility models. The mobility models used in this work are Random Waypoint, Reference Point Group and Manhattan Grid. Obtained results show that the best combination protocol/mobility depends on the average speed of nodes.",

The solution focuses on establishing appropriate flow filtering rules based on parameters such as' time feature'and internet control message protocol'(ICMP) protocol'. The tests were conducted using the Openstack platform. One of the key benefits of this proposed approach is the improved performance in effectively detecting a significant number of malicious packets. We implemented this solution on the Openstack platform and conducted evaluations to demonstrate its efficacy. The results confirm that our method achieves superior performance in detecting MitM attacks, with a packet detection ratio (PDR) of 60.4%. Moving forward, this work will contribute to protecting cloud environments from a large number of MitM attacks.",

Several routing schemes are proposed to improve the reliability of data delivery between vehicles. These protocols still suffer from the growth of the data packet delivery delay, the lost data packets, and the control packets. For this reason, we propose a novel cross‐layer routing protocol, which is the first that uses virtual multibackbones and combines them with the quality of the link to choose the next forwarder vehicle. The next candidate forwarders, among neighbors, are those that keep a minimum of link quality during the data packet delivery delay. Then, among these candidates, we select that is closest to the destination vehicle to receive and forward the data. In addition, our proposal gives …",

In this study, we explore a variant called the Close Enough TSP, characterized by dynamic targets within the communication ranges of cluster head (CH) nodes. This scenario requires data collection by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which need not directly overfly each node. We propose a new method that blends metaheuristic algorithms with geometric heuristics to create a near-optimal UAV flight path.

Precisely, the estimates of φ-mutual informations, associated to φ-divergences between a joint distribution and the product distribution of its marginals, are derived through the dual representation of φ-divergences. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimates are established, including consistency, asymptotic distributions, and large deviations principle. The obtained tests of independence are compared via their relative asymptotic Bahadur efficiency and numerical simulations. It follows that the proposed semiparametric mutual information test is the optimal one. On the other hand, the proposed approach provides a new method for estimating the mutual information in a semiparametric setting, as well as a model selection procedure in a large class of dependence models, including semiparametric copulas.",

    "Title": "New approach for efficiently retrieving similar 3D models based on reducing the research space",
    "Abstract": "The need of efficient methods for 3D shape retrieval that satisfies simultaneously the computational efficiency (Fastness) and the quality of the retrieval results (Relevance), is an active topic in various research communities. Designing such methods is a great challenge. In order to satisfy the computational efficiency without affecting the performance, we propose in this paper a novel approach that adjusts the compromise \"Fastness/Relevance\". Our key idea is to reduce the research space during the retrieval process, by ignoring 3D-objects that are not similar to the query. To do this, we propose to cooperate two existing methods. The first one satisfies the condition of the fastness while the second one satisfies the condition of the relevance. First, we use the fastness method to reduce the research space. Then, the second method is used to perform the retrieval in the reduced research space. For experimental tests, we have applied our approach to BF-SIFT and CM-BOF methods. The obtained experimental results, on the PSB database, show that our approach efficiently adjusts the compromise \"Fastness/Relevance\". © 2014 by IJIR.",

    "Abstract": "As the size of 3D object databases grows rapidly, the emerging issue related to 3D shape retrieval in a distributed database is interesting to consider. In this paper, we propose extended methods designed for centralized databases, especially those based upon Bagof- Features (BoF) approach for shape indexing. Such methods use a visual dictionary (codebook) for computing the descriptor of a given 3D object. This codebook is obtained by clustering a set of features obtained from all the objects of the database. Such clustering, however, does not suit distributed databases very well, particularly because it gets too timeconsuming. Our solution consists in associating a local codebook to each database and then generating a distributed codebook from the local codebooks only instead of directly dealing with all the objects of each distributed database. Experimental results show that the obtained relevance with our proposed approach is very close to the case of a centralized codebook.",

    "Title": "New technique for 3D shape retrieval in the classified databases",
    "Abstract": "This study addresses the problem of 3D shape retrieval. While this problem is interesting and emerging as the size of 3D object databases grows rapidly, the main two issues the community has to focus on are: Computational efficiency of 3D object retrieval and the quality of retrieval results. In this study we deal with the two considerations, especially the first one namely computational efficiency, by proposing a new technique to retrieve efficiently the 3D-objects in the classified databases which contains 3D objects of different categories. This technique can be coupled with any 3D retrieval method. In this study, we use the Clock Matching Bag-of-Features 3D retrieval method proposed by Lian et al. (2010) since it gives the best result comparing with several methods in particular the view based methods. Instead of systematically matching the object-query with all 3D objects of the target database, our approach restricts the pattern matching on a subset of \"good candidates\" (the most similar to the query). For a database classified in several classes the retrieval will be oriented to the right class that contains similar objects to the query. In this case, the matching process will be not systematically performed with all objects among the database, but only with objects of right class. Our key idea is to represent each class by one representative that will be used to orient the retrieval process to the right class. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of our approach. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.",

    "Abstract": "This work addresses the problem of content-based 3D shape retrieval. Despite the variety of approaches proposed in the literature, the challenge that still lies ahead is to design a method that allows large-scale retrieval and respects relevance. In this paper, we offer a complete system that takes full advantage of deep learning. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for shape indexing, our key idea is to consider the final output (softmax layer) of a well-trained model as a given 3D object’s descriptor. This solution is employed not only to improve relevance but also to accelerate the shape matching process. In addi-tion to serving as the search key, the considered descriptor is used to predict the models’ list to match. Hence, this will avoid a sequential and systematic comparison with all the 3D models in the database. To evaluate our approach with state-of-the-art methods, we use the SHREC’17 event specifications and ShapeNetCore subset data. We demonstrate that the proposed shape indexing technique improves the relevance and accelerates the retrieval process significantly.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we exploit the potential of the GPU in order to accelerate the process of 3D shape retrieval in large databases. Indeed, the massive parallelism of the GPU offers a huge performance in much high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Our solution consists to accelerate the shape matching process of methods that use a specific similarity metric called Clock Matching (CM). This CM measure is used by view-based methods as an efficient solution to compare two 3D models even if they are not presented in same pose and orientation by taking into account all possible poses in the matching phase. However, the increase in the number of comparisons has a strong influence on the execution time. Our challenge is to exploit the maximum benefit of GPU computing resource by considering the difficulty of implementing the CM metric on GPU. Indeed, the descriptor of a given 3D object is organized using a specific data structure (hash table), where only the information whose values are not equal to zero appears in the feature vector, which makes the parallelization on GPU to be not trivial. Experiment results show a reasonable benefit from the GPU approach.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we consider the scheduling problem of a set of periodic implicit-deadline and synchronous tasks, on a real-time multiprocessor composed of m identical processors. It is known that the cost of migrations and preemptions has significant influence on global system performances. The EKG algorithm can generate a great number of migrant tasks, but it has the advantage that each migrant task migrates between two processors only. Later, the EDHS algorithm has been proposed in order to minimize the number of migrant tasks of EKG. Although EDHS minimizes the number of migration compared to EKG, its drawback is the generation of additional preemptions caused by the migrations on several processors. In this paper we propose a new tasks allocation algorithm that aims to combine the advantages of EKG (migrations between two processors only) and those of EDHS (reduction of number of migrations).",

    "Title": "Roadmap for an Arabic Controlled Language",
    "Abstract": "Controlled Natural Languages or CNLs are artificial subsets of natural languages that aim to make communication clearer and more precise. In general, CNLs are used in communication between humans or with computers and, particularly, when clarity and unambiguity are required. Existing CNLs have been developed to be exploited in many applications such as technical documentation, machine translation or database query language. So far, many CNLs have been developed for Western languages, especially English, but no concrete CNL has yet been proposed for Arabic even with the increasing number of Arabic Internet users in the last two decades. In this paper, we propose a roadmap for developing an Arabic CNL to provide new kind and advanced natural language services for Arabic people. Methodologically speaking, we review the most important existing CNLs in English and other languages helping us knowing some statistics related to the vocabulary size and the number of grammar rules that could help in designing the new CNL. This paper proposes two major approaches; one relies on leveraging on already-built CNLs, whereas the other consists in starting from scratch. The survey of Arabic NLP challenges along the available resources and tools allowed us to favor the second approach as the basis for the proposed roadmap.",

We have developed a new algorithm based on a penalized mutual information criterion recently introduced in [El Rhabi et al., A penalized mutual information criterion for blind separation of convolutive mixtures, Signal Processing 84 (2004) 1979-1984] and which also allows to choose an optimal separator among an infinite number of valid separators that can extract the source signals in a certain sense according to the Minimal Distortion Principle. So, the minimisation of this criterion is easily done using a direct gradient approach without constraint on the displacements. Thus, our approach allows to restore directly the contribution of the sources to the sensor signals without post-processing as it is usually done.

It employs four partial differential equations incorporating fractional derivatives and account for diffusion to characterize infection dynamics. By applying fixed-point theorem results, the paper establishes the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of the solution. Equilibrium points are determined based on vaccination values and the basic reproduction number R0. Global stability of each equilibrium is confirmed using the Lyapunov direct method. Through simulations with a predictor–corrector algorithm, key insights into epidemiological dynamics are provided, elucidating the impact of vaccination on reducing disease transmission and altering R0. Trajectories of various compartments closely align with theoretical equilibrium points, affirming the model's predictive precision. Furthermore, simulations indicate the potential for attaining disease-free equilibria with heightened vaccination rates, underscoring the pivotal role of vaccination strategies in epidemic control and disease eradication. It was shown that the fractional derivative order has no effect on the equilibrium stability but rather only on the convergence speed towards the equilibrium points.",

An analysis of Lyapunov functions is used to determine the global stability of the model. By introducing stochastic elements into the model, we can examine its stability under random perturbations.

Our study examines how delay impacts mathematical models of TB, HIV, and AIDS. There are four classes in the proposed system — Susceptibles, TB infectives, HIV infectives (with or without TB), and AIDS patients. A model shows four states of equilibrium: disease-free, HIV-free, TB-free, and endemic. If the reproduction number R0 is less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. If R0 greater than one, at least one infection will be present in the population Positive endemic equilibrium is always locally stable, but it can become globally stable under certain circumstances, indicating the disease has become endemic. TB and HIV infections drop as a result of recovery, and endemic equilibrium leads to TB free conditions. The number of people living with AIDS declines when TB is not associated with HIV infection. The model is also numerically analyzed to see how some important parameters affect the disease's progression. Mathematical and numerical methods are employed to study the impact of delay.",

In this paper, a novel fractional-order model is used to investigate the epidemiological impact of vaccination measures on the co-dynamics of viral hepatitis B and COVID-19. To investigate the existence and stability of the new model, we use some fixed point theory results. The COVID-19 and viral hepatitis B thresholds are estimated using the model fitting. The vaccine parameters are plotted against transmission coefficients. The effect of non-integer derivatives on the solution paths for each epidemiological state and the trajectory diagram for infected classes are also examined numerically. An infection-free steady state and an infection-present equilibrium are achieved when (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.), respectively. Similarly, phase portraits confirm the behaviour of the infected components, showing that, regardless of the order of the fractional derivative, the trajectories of the disease classes always converge toward infection-free steady states over time, no matter what initial conditions are assumed for the diseases. The model has been verified using real observations.",

    "Abstract": "This study aims to investigate the potential impact of inhibitors targeting the papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 on viral replication and the host immune response. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the interaction among susceptible cells, infected cells, PLpro, and immune cells, incorporating data on PLpro inhibition. Through numerical simulations using MATLAB, the model parameters were estimated based on available statistical data. The results indicate that strategically positioned inhibitors could impede the virus's access to host cellular machinery, thereby enhancing the immune response and gradually reducing susceptible and infected cells over time. The dynamics of the viral enzyme PLpro showed reduced activity with the introduction of the inhibitor, leading to a decline in viral replication. Moreover, the immune cell population exhibited functional recovery as the inhibitor suppressed PLpro activity. These findings suggest that inhibitors targeting PLpro may serve as therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting viral replication and bolstering the immune response.",

This work was purposed to introduce an epidemiological model to represent the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission through the use of stochastic differential equations. First, we formulated the model and derived the well-posedness to show that the proposed epidemiological problem is biologically and mathematically feasible. We then calculated the stochastic reproductive parameters for the proposed stochastic epidemiological model and analyzed the model extinction and persistence.

This study focuses on the vital task of comprehending the dynamics of HIV-COVID-19 co-infection, a fundamental step in formulating efficacious control strategies and optimizing healthcare approaches. Here, we introduce an innovative mathematical model grounded in Caputo fractional order differential equations, specifically designed to encapsulate the intricate dynamics of co-infection. This model encompasses multiple critical facets: the transmission dynamics of both HIV and COVID-19, the host's immune responses, and the influence of treatment interventions. Our approach embraces the complexity of these factors to offer an exhaustive portrayal of co-infection dynamics. To tackle the fractional order model, we employ the Laplace-Adomian decomposition method, a potent mathematical tool for approximating solutions in fractional order differential equations. Utilizing this technique, we simulate the intricate interactions between these variables, yielding profound insights into the propagation of co-infection. Notably, we identify pivotal contributors to its advancement. In addition, we conduct a meticulous analysis of the convergence properties inherent in the series solutions acquired through the Laplace-Adomian decomposition method. This examination assures the reliability and accuracy of our mathematical methodology in approximating solutions. Our findings hold significant implications for the formulation of effective control strategies.

    "Title": "Modeling different infectious phases of hepatitis B with generalized saturated incidence: An analysis and control",
    "Abstract": "Hepatitis B is one of the global health issues caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), producing 1.1 million deaths yearly. The acute and chronic phases of HBV are significant because worldwide, approximately 250 million people are infected by chronic hepatitis B. The chronic stage is a long-term, persistent infection that can cause liver damage and increase the risk of liver cancer. In the case of multiple phases of infection, a generalized saturated incidence rate model is more reasonable than a simply saturated incidence because it captures the complex dynamics of the different infection phases. In contrast, a simple saturated incidence rate model assumes a fixed shape for the incidence rate curve, which may not accurately reflect the dynamics of multiple infection phases. Considering HBV and its various phases, we constructed a model to present the dynamics and control strategies using the generalized saturated incidence. First, we proved that the model is well-posed. We then found the reproduction quantity and model equilibria to discuss the time dynamics of the model and investigate the conditions for stabilities. We also examined a control mechanism by introducing various controls to the model with the aim to increase the population of those recovered and minimize the infected people. We performed numerical experiments to check the biological significance and control implementation.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a delay differential model with fractional order for glucose-insulin endocrine, metabolic regulation model, incorporating beta-cell dynamics to regulate and maintain bloodstream insulin concentration. In the model, two time delays are involved, namely δg and δι, which represent delayed insulin secretion and delayed glucose reduction. A moderate hyperglycemia results in beta-cell growth (negative feedback), while a severe hyperglycemia results in beta-cell reduction (positive feedback). When a time delay passes a bifurcation point, Hopf bifurcation occurs. It is evident from biological findings that the model exhibits periodic oscillations. Furthermore, we present an optimal control problem for external insulin infusions to minimize prolonged high blood sugar levels. Numerical simulations have validated the theoretical results.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to present a mathematical model of tumor vaccine efficacy in the context of immunotherapy treatment. The model is governed by fractional-order delay differential equations with a control variable. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) inhibition alone gives limited clinical advantages, but when combined with a tumor vaccine, it can dramatically increase the immune system's anti-tumor response. The mathematical model takes into account tumor growth dynamics, TGF-β concentrations, cytotoxic effector cells, and regulatory T-cells. The non-negativity of the solutions to such a model has been examined. The steady-state stability and Hopf bifurcation of tumor time delays τ are investigated. An optimal fractional-order control problem is derived and analyzed in the presence of immunotherapy treatments. Using Adams–Bashforth–Moulton predictor–corrector algorithms, we illustrate numerical examples that confirm the analytical findings. The optimal control treatment method reduces the load of tumor cells while increasing the effector cells.",

    "Abstract": "Even though diabetes is a silent killer and one of the world’s leading public health issues, people can take preventative measures by becoming aware of its causes. This study aims to identify the importance of treatment function and then control the complications of various individuals. We present a mathematical model of diabetes (type-2 diabetes) based on insulin therapy as a controlling factor. With fractional-order delay differential equations, four parts of the population control the dynamic system. The well-posedness (positivity, boundedness) of the model is examined to show that it is biologically and mathematically relevant. According to the characteristics equations for the model, certain sufficient conditions must be met for diabetic-free, endemic equilibrium points to be stable locally. To assess the imbalanced glucose level and treatment over a finite time period, we construct an optimal control problem based on treatment control and awareness program control as time-dependent control parameters. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is examined. In order to determine the most cost-effective treatment strategy with limited resources, we assessed the effectiveness and costs of treatments. The theoretical findings are verified by numerical simulations.",

The transmission dynamics of the disease are studied by incorporating the saturated incidence rate into the model.

The positivity, boundedness, existence, and uniqueness of the solution of the model are also studied. Equilibrium solutions are computed, and their stability analyses are shown to depend on a threshold quantity, the basic reproduction ratio ((Formula presented.)). It is clearly shown that if (Formula presented.) the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, whereas if (Formula presented.), the endemic equilibrium exists and is locally asymptotically stable.

Fractional-order differential equations are beneficial for incorporating memory and hereditary properties into systems. Our paper proposes an asymptomatic COVID-19 model with three delay terms τ1,τ2,τ3 and fractional-order α. Multiple constant time delays are included in the model to account for the latency of infection in a vector. We study the necessary and sufficient criteria for stability of steady states and Hopf bifurcations based on the three constant time-delays, τ1, τ2, and τ3. Hopf bifurcation occurs in the addressed model at the estimated bifurcation points τ10, τ20, τ30, and τ10*.

Two new stability theorems on finite and FXT stability of FOIDSs with finite impulsive instants are derived using an indefinite LF and fractional derivatives of the LF on some impulsive instants, respectively. The settling time is explicitly calculated. The obtained theoretical findings are applied to fractional-order discontinuous multi-agent systems. Discrete control schemes and indefinite Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions (LKFs) are also developed for ensuring FXT synchronization in fractional-order discontinuous multiagent systems.

    "Abstract": "It is a known fact that there are a particular set of people who are at higher risk of getting COVID-19 infection. Typically, these high-risk individuals are recommended to take more preventive measures. The use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and the vaccine are playing a major role in the dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19. We propose a COVID-19 model with high-risk and low-risk susceptible individuals and their respective intervention strategies. We find two equilibrium solutions and we investigate the basic reproduction number. We also carry out the stability analysis of the equilibria. Further, this model is extended by considering the vaccination of some non-vaccinated individuals in the high-risk population. Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations are carried out. From the results, we are able to obtain disease-free and endemic equilibrium solutions by solving the system of equations in the model and show their global stabilities using the Lyapunov function technique. The results obtained from the sensitivity analysis shows that reducing the hospitals’ imperfect efficacy can have a positive impact on the control of COVID-19. Finally, simulations of the extended model demonstrate that vaccination could adequately control or eliminate COVID-19.",

    "Title": "SEINN: A deep learning algorithm for the stochastic epidemic model",
    "Abstract": "Stochastic modeling predicts various outcomes from stochasticity in the data, parameters and dynamical system. Stochastic models are deemed more appropriate than deterministic models accounting in terms of essential and practical information about a system. The objective of the current investigation is to address the issue above through the development of a novel deep neural network referred to as a stochastic epidemiology-informed neural network. This network learns knowledge about the parameters and dynamics of a stochastic epidemic vaccine model. Our analysis centers on examining the nonlinear incidence rate of the model from the perspective of the combined effects of vaccination and stochasticity. Based on empirical evidence, stochastic models offer a more comprehensive understanding than deterministic models, mainly when we use error metrics. The findings of our study indicate that a decrease in randomness and an increase in vaccination rates are associated with a better prediction of nonlinear incidence rates. Adopting a nonlinear incidence rate enables a more comprehensive representation of the complexities of transmitting diseases. The computational analysis of the proposed method, focusing on sensitivity analysis and overfitting analysis, shows that the proposed method is efficient. Our research aims to guide policymakers on the effects of stochasticity in epidemic models, thereby aiding the development of effective vaccination and mitigation policies.

Stability analysis of the solutions of the model is carried out. Numerical simulations are carried out and the effects of negative and positive attitudes towards vaccination areclearly shown; the significance of the fractional-order from the biological point of view is also established. The positive effect of increasing awareness, which in turn increases positive attitudes towards vaccination, is also shown numerically.The results show that negative attitudes towards vaccination increase infectious disease proliferation and this can only be limited by mounting awareness campaigns in the population.

    "Abstract": "The focus of the current manuscript is to provide a theoretical and computational analysis of the new nonlinear time-fractional (2+1)-dimensional modified KdV equation involving the Atangana-Baleanu Caputo (ABC) derivative.

The notion of fixed point theory is used for the derivation of the results related to the existence of at least one and unique solution of the mKdV equation involving under ABC-derivative. The theorems of fixed point theory are also used to derive results regarding to the convergence and Picard’s X-stability of the proposed computational method. A proper investigation is conducted through graphical representation of the achieved solution to determine that the ABC operator produces better dynamics of the obtained analytic soliton solution. Finally, 2D and 3D graphs are used to compare the exact solution and approximate solution. Also, a comparison between the exact solution, solution under Caputo-Fabrizio, and solution under the ABC operator of the proposed equation is provided through graphs, which reflect that ABC-operator produces better dynamics of the proposed equation than the Caputo-Fabrizio one.",

As a first step, some stability conditions are presented in two theorems to verify fixed-time stability (F-TS) of FOSs by using Lyapunov stability theory and indefinite Lyapunov functionals, where the fractional-order derivative of the indefinite functions may not exist. Furthermore, the corresponding estimated settling time of FOSs is also provided. Second, the results are extended to study fractional-order neural networks (FONNs) with time-delays in fixed-time synchronization. Using the Dirac delta functions, we propose an explicit saturated impulsive controller to synchronize the master and slave systems. Moreover, by constructing suitable indefinite Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions (LKF), we derive algebraic conditions to guarantee the fixed-time synchronization of the addressed FONNs.

    "Abstract": "Combining Sterile and Incompatible Insect techniques can significantly reduce mosquito populations and prevent the transmission of diseases between insects and humans. This paper describes impulsive differential equations for the control of a mosquito with Wolbachia. Several interesting conditions are created when sterile male mosquitoes are released impulsively, ensuring both open- and closed-loop control. To determine the wild mosquito population size in real-time, we propose an open-loop control system, which uses impulsive and constant releases of sterile male mosquitoes. A closed-loop control scheme is also being investigated, which specifies the release of sterile mosquitoes according to the size of the wild mosquito population. To eliminate or reduce a mosquito population below a certain threshold, the Sterile insect technique involves mass releases of sterile insects. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical results.",

Cancer-immune interactions can, however, be greatly disrupted by random factors, such as physiological rhythms, environmental factors, and cell-to-cell communication. The present study introduces a stochastic differential model in infectious diseases and immunology of the dynamics of a tumorimmune system with random noise. Stationary ergodic distribution of positive solutions to the system is investigated in which the solution fluctuates around the equilibrium of the deterministic case and causes the disease to persist stochastically. In some conditions, it may be possible to attain infection-free status, where diseases die out exponentially with a probability of one. Some numerical simulations are conducted with the Euler–Maruyama scheme in order to verify the results. White noise intensity is a key factor in treating infectious diseases.",

For the dynamics of COVID-19, we propose a stochastic epidemic model, with time-delays, Susceptible–Infected–Asymptomatic–Quarantined–Recovered (SIAQR). One global positive solution exists with probability one in the model. As a threshold condition of persistence and existence of an ergodic stationary distribution, we deduce a generalized stochastic threshold R0s<R0. To estimate the percentages of people who must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, least-squares approaches were used to estimate R0 from real observations in the UAE. Our results suggest that when R0>1, a proportion max(1−1/R0) of the population needs to be immunized/vaccinated during the pandemic wave.

The necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal control are established. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal control problem. To recognize significant system's parameters, sensitivity analysis are performed for the drug administration and cost functional respectively. We also carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the most cost-effective therapeutic strategy.

Vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions only remain extensive measures carrying a significant socioeconomic impact to defeating pandemic. Here, we formulate a mathematical model with comorbidity to study the transmission dynamics as well as an optimal control-based framework to diminish COVID-19. This encompasses modeling the dynamics of invaded population, parameter estimation of the model, study of qualitative dynamics, and optimal control problem for non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination events such that the cost of the combined measure is minimized. The investigation reveals that disease persists with the increase in exposed individuals having comorbidity in society. The extensive computational efforts show that mean fluctuations in the force of infection increase with corresponding entropy. This is a piece of evidence that the outbreak has reached a significant portion of the population. However, optimal control strategies with combined measures provide an assurance of effectively protecting our population from COVID-19 by minimizing social and economic costs.",

    "Title": "Quasi-pinning synchronization and stabilization of fractional order BAM neural networks with delays and discontinuous neuron activations",
    "Abstract": "This manuscript concerns quasi-pinning synchronization and β-exponential pinning stabilization for a class of fractional order BAM neural networks with time-varying delays and discontinuous neuron activations (FBAMNNDDAs). Firstly, under the framework of Filippov solution and fractional-order differential inclusions analysis for the initial value problem of FBAMNNDDAs is presented. Secondly, two kinds of novel pinning controllers according to pinning control technique are designed. By means of fractional order Lyapunov method and designed pinning control strategy, the sufficient criteria is given first to ensure the quasi-synchronization for the dynamic behavior of FBAMNNDDAs. Furthermore, the error bound of pinning synchronization is explicitly evaluated. Thirdly, via Kakutani s fixed point theorem of set-valued map analysis, Razumikhin condition, and a nonlinear pinning controller, the existence and β-exponential stabilization of FBAMNNDDAs equilibrium point is obtained in the voice of linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Fourthly, based on as well as Mittag-Leffler function and growth condition, the global existence of a solution in the Filippov sense of such system is guaranteed with detailed proof. At last, a numerical example with computer simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed theoretical consequences.",

    "Title": "Stability and Hopf Bifurcation of Three-Species Prey-Predator System with Time Delays and Allee Effect",
    "Abstract": "Allee effect is one of the important factors in ecology, and taking it into account can cause significant impacts in the system dynamics. In this paper, we study the dynamics of a two-prey one-predator system, where the growth of both prey populations is subject to Allee effects, and there is a direct competition between the two-prey species having a common predator. Two discrete time delays τ1 and τ2 are incorporated into the model to represent reaction time of predators. Sufficient conditions for local stability of positive interior equilibrium and existence of Hopf bifurcations in terms of threshold parameters τ1∗ and τ2∗ are obtained. A Lyapunov functional is deducted to investigate the global stability of positive interior equilibrium. Sensitivity analysis to evaluate the uncertainty of the state variables to small changes in the Allee parameters is also investigated. Presence of Allee effect and time delays in the model increases the complexity of the model and enriches the dynamics of the system. Some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. The model is highly sensitive to small changes in Allee parameters at the early stages and with low population densities, and this sensitivity decreases with time.",

    "Title": "A fractional-order epidemic model with time-delay and nonlinear incidence rate",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, we provide an epidemic SIR model with long-range temporal memory. The model is governed by delay differential equations with fractional-order. We assume that the susceptible is obeying the logistic form in which the incidence term is of saturated form with the susceptible. Several theoretical results related to the existence of steady states and the asymptotic stability of the steady states are discussed. We use a suitable Lyapunov functional to formulate a new set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the global stability of the steady states. The occurrence of Hopf bifurcation is captured when the time-delay τ passes through a critical value τ*. Theoretical results are validated numerically by solving the governing system, using the modified Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector scheme. Our findings show that the combination of fractional-order derivative and time-delay in the model improves the dynamics and increases complexity of the model. In some cases, the phase portrait gets stretched as the order of the derivative is reduced.",

The model includes constant delays in the mitotic phase to justify the time required to stimulate the effector cells and for the effector cells to develop a suitable response to the tumour cells. By applying optimal control theory, we seek to minimize the cost associated with the immuno-chemotherapy and to reduce load of of tumour cells. Non-Negativity of the solutions of the model and existence of an optimal control has also been proven. Optimality conditions and characterization of the control are also discussed. We numerically approximate the solution of the optimal control problem by solving the state system forward and adjoint system backward in time. The numerical simulations show that the combination of immuno-chemotherapy protocol reduces the tumour load in few months of therapy.",

We mainly investigate whether the time of quiescence (delay) in the females phase can induce Hopf bifurcation. By means of analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum, we show that the persistent positive equilibrium is asymptotically stable in the absence of time delay, but loses its stability via Hopf bifurcation when time delay crosses some critical value. Using normal form and center manifold theory, we investigate the stability of the bifurcating branches of periodic solutions and the direction of the Hopf bifurcation.

The considered transition probabilities are assumed to be partially unknown. In addition, the sampling period is assumed to be time-varying that switches between two different values in a random way with given probability. Several delay-dependent synchronization criteria have been derived to guarantee the exponential stability of the error systems and the master systems are stochastically synchronized with the slave systems. By introducing an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) including new triple integral terms, free-weighting matrices, partly unknown transition probabilities and combining both the convex combination technique and reciprocal convex technique, a delay-dependent exponential stability criteria is obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The information about the lower bound of the discrete time-varying delay is fully used in the LKF. Furthermore, the desired sampled-data synchronization controllers can be solved in terms of the solution to LMIs.

    "Abstract": "This paper deals with stability and Hopf bifurcation analyses of a mathematical model of HIV infection of CD 4 + T-cells. The model is based on a system of delay differential equations with logistic growth term and antiretroviral treatment with a discrete time delay, which plays a main role in changing the stability of each steady state. By fixing the time delay as a bifurcation parameter, we get a limit cycle bifurcation about the infected steady state. We study the effect of the time delay on the stability of the endemically infected equilibrium. We derive explicit formulae to determine the stability and direction of the limit cycles by using center manifold theory and normal form method. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the results.",

    "Abstract": "Recently, a large number of mathematical models that are described by delay differential equations (DDEs) have appeared in the life sciences. In this paper, we present a delay differential model to describe the interactions between the effector and tumour cells. The existence of the possible steady states and their local stability and change of stability via Hopf bifurcation are theoretically and numerically investigated. Parameter estimation problem for given real observations, using least squares approach, is studied. The global stability and sensitivity analysis are also numerically proved for the model. The stability and periodicity of the solutions may depend on the time-lag parameter. The model is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations of immune-induced tumour dormancy. The model also predicts dormancy as a transient period of growth which necessarily results in either tumour elimination or tumour escape. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The intracellular delay is incorporated into the model to justify the time required to stimulate the effector cells.

Existence of the optimal control pair and optimality systemare established. Pontryagin's maximum principle is applicable to characterize the optimal controls. The model displays a tumour-free steady state and up to three coexisting steady states. The numerical results show that the optimal treatment strategies reduce the tumour cells load and increase the effector cells after a few days of therapy.

The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility of eliminating the infections in static as well as exponentially growing populations with a public health strategy based solely on vaccination. The critical vaccination rate ψ* above which the endemic infection dies out and the conditions on model parameters that ensure its existence are obtained. It has been found that eliminating the infection requires an application of control measures other than vaccination to reduce the basic reproduction number to below the reinfection threshold and then vaccinate susceptible individuals with a rate slightly greater than ψ *. The implication is that, generally, even if all newborns get vaccinated immediately after birth, an effective control is not necessarily assured except if the basic reproduction number is reduced to below the reinfection threshold. We further include the fatality of the infection and investigate its impact on the dynamics. Some numerical simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical analysis. © 2011 IMACS.

The paper divides naturally into two parts: in the first, we expound the inter-connection between ordinary differential equations, delay-differential equations, neutral delay-differential equations and integral equations (with emphasis on certain linear cases). As we show, this leads to a natural hierarchy of model complexity when such equations are used in mathematical and computational modelling, and to the possibility of reformulating problems either to facilitate their numerical solution or to provide mathematical insight, or both. Volterra integral equations include as special cases the others we consider. In the second part, we develop some practical and theoretical consequences of results given in the first part. In particular, we consider various approaches to the definition of an adjoint, we establish (notably, in the context of sensitivity analysis for neutral delay-differential equations) rôles for well-defined adjoints and 'quasi-adjoints', and we explore relationships between sensitivity analysis, the variation of parameters formulae, the fundamental solution and adjoints. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abstract": "It is known that Alekseev's variation of parameters formula for ordinary differential equations can be generalized to other types of causal equations (including delay differential equations and Volterra integral equations), and corresponding discrete forms. Such variation of parameters formulae can be employed, together with appropriate inequalities, in discussing the behaviour of solutions of continuous and discretized problems, the significance of parameters in mathematical models, sensitivity and stability issues, bifurcation, and (in classical numerical analysis) error control, convergence and super-convergence of densely defined approximations and error analysis in general. However, attempts to extend Alekseev's formula to nonlinear Volterra integral equations are not straightforward, and difficulties can recur in attempts to analyze the sensitivity of functionally-dependent or structurally-dependent solutions. In analyzing sensitivity we discuss behaviour for infinitesimally small perturbations. In discussions of stability we need to establish the existence of bounds on changes to solutions (or their decay in the limit as t→∞) that ensue from perturbations in the problem. Yet the two topics are related, not least through variation of parameters formulae, and (motivated by some of our recent results) we discuss this and related issues within a general framework. © 2005 IMACS.

These parameters may be the model's initial conditions, its boundary conditions, or other tunable parameters which have to be determined. Four dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) is a method of estimating this set of parameters by optimizing the fit between the solution of the model and a set of observations which the model is meant to predict. Although the method of 4D-Var described in this paper is not restricted to any particular system, the application described here has a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model at its core, and the parameters to be determined are the initial conditions of the model. The purpose of this paper is to give a review covering assimilation of Doppler radar wind data into a NWP model.

We demonstrate our method of solving parameter estimation problems for neutral delay differential equations by analyzing some models of cell growth that incorporate a time-lag in the cell division phase. We show that these models are more consistent with certain reported data than the classic exponential growth model. Although the exponential growth model provides estimates of some of the growth characteristics, such as the population-doubling time, the time-lag growth models can additionally provide estimates of: (i) the fraction of cells that are dividing, (ii) the rate of commitment of cells to cell division, (iii) the initial distribution of cells in the cell cycle, and (iv) the degree of synchronization of cells in the (initial) cell population. © Springer-Verlag 1998.",

To understand the complete interactions between these elements, we study a spatially homogeneous simplified model that allows us to determine the effect of key parameters such as degradation rates in the asymptotic behaviour of the system and the stability of equilibrium. We observe that inflammation appears to be a crucial factor in the initiation and progression of AD through a phenomenon of hysteresis with respect to the oligomer degradation rate d. This means that depending on the advanced state of the disease (given by the value of the A β -monomer degradation rate d: large value for an early stage and low value for an advanced stage) there exists a critical threshold of initial concentration of interleukins that determines if the disease persists or not in the long term. These results give perspectives on possible anti-inflammatory treatments that could be applied to mitigate the progression of AD. We also present numerical simulations that allow us to observe the effect of initial inflammation and monomer concentration in our model.",

While it had the significant advantage of dealing with linear equations, the approximations involved may have led to several non-physical predictions. This work is a continuation of Curtiss and Bird (1996) in that it obtains the corresponding non-linear configurational probability density equation in dimensionless form without the linear gradient approximations for the temperature field and Brownian forces. It does so for incompressible diluted polymer solutions with polymer molecules being modeled as FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) chains. Next we prove the existence of temperature dependent, positive variational solutions for the probability density equation of the FENE model.",

A simplified form without bubbles convection is studied here. This coupled model seems never to be studied before from its mathematical aspects.

    "Title": "Fragmentation and monomer lengthening of rod-like polymers, a relevant model for prion proliferation",
    "Abstract": "The Greer, Pujo-Menjouet and Webb model [Greer et al., J. Theoret. Biol., 242 (2006), 598-606] for prion dynamics was found to be in good agreement with experimental observations under no-ow conditions. The objective of this work is to generalize the problem to the framework of general polymerization- fragmentation under ow motion, motivated by the fact that laboratory work often involves prion dynamics under ow conditions in order to observe faster processes. Moreover, understanding and modelling the microstructure inuence of macroscopically monitored non-Newtonian behaviour is crucial for sensor design, with the goal to provide practical information about ongoing molecular evolution. This paper's results can then be considered as one step in the mathematical understanding of such models, namely the proof of positivity and existence of solutions in suitable functional spaces. To that purpose, we introduce a new model based on the rigid-rod polymer theory to account for the polymer dynamics under ow conditions. As expected, when applied to the prion problem, in the absence of motion it reduces to that in Greer et al. (2006). At the heart of any polymer kinetical theory there is a conffgurational probability diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) of Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski type. The main mathematical result of this paper is the proof of existence of positive solutions to the aforementioned PDE for a class of ows of practical interest, taking into account the ow induced splitting/lengthening of polymers in general, and prions in particular.",

This interaction leads to the misconformation of PrPc into pathogenic oligomeric prions, PrPol. We develop here a model describing in vitro Aβ polymerization process. We include interactions between oligomers and PrPc, causing the misconformation of PrPc into PrPol. The model consists of nine equations, including size structured transport equations, ordinary differential equations and delayed differential equations. We analyse the well-posedness of the model and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of our model using Schauder fixed point and Cauchy-Lipschitz theorems.

    "Title": "The influence of roughness in the equilibrium problem in lubrication with imposed load",
    "Abstract": "In this article we study a lubricated system consisting on a slider moving over a smooth surface and a known external force (the load) applied upon the slider. The slider moves at constant velocity and close proximity to the surface and the gap is filled by an incompressible fluid (the lubricant). At the equilibrium, the position of the slider presents one degree of freedom to be determined by the balance of forces acting on the system: the load and the total force exerted by the pressure of the lubricant. The pressure distribution is described by a variational inequality of elliptic type known as Swift-Stieber model and based on Reynolds equation. The distance h between the surfaces in a two dimensional domain ω is given by h ( x 1 , x 2 , y ) = h 0 ( x 1 , x 2 ) + h 1 ( y ) + , ( x 1 , x 2 ) ω , y [ 0 , 1 ] where h 0 ( x 1 , x 2 ) | x 1 | α for α > 0 and h 1 ( y ) | y - y 0 | β for y being the homogenization variable. The main result of the article quantify the influence of the roughness in the load capacity of the mechanism in the following way: If α < 3 for 0 < 2 α < min { 1 - 2 , 3 } for > 2 then, the mechanism presents finite load capacity, i.e. lim → 0 ω p < ∞. Infinite load capacity is obtained for > 1 and α > 2 / ( - 1 ). A one dimensional particular case is given for > 3 / 2 with infinite load capacity.",

In this article, the effect of arbitrary uniform periodic textures on the load-carrying capacity of lubricated devices known as thrust bearings is investigated theoretically by means of homogenization techniques and first-order perturbation analysis. It is shown that the untextured shape is a local optimum for the load-carrying capacity of the homogenized pressure field. This is proved for bearings of general shape and considering both incompressible and compressible models for the lubricant. The homogenization technique however implies an error. Suitable bounds for the effect of this error are provided in a simplified case. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The asymptotic expansion of the solution u to the equation ∇ (α∇u) ≤ -∇ β + γ in , with respect to the size ε of an inclusion (at a point x0 of the domain Ω) in which the parameters α, β and γ are changed, is studied. Writing the difference with the unperturbed solution as u - uε ≤ εnzε, it is shown that the sequence z ε converges weakly, for all p < n/(n - 1) and ρ > 0, to a function z in Lp(Ω)∩H1(Ω B ρ(x0)), where Bρ(x0) is the ball of radius ρ around x0. This allows for the calculation of asymptotic expansions of cost functions of the form J(ε) ≤ ∫ΩF(uε) dx, for example, rendering it useful for many applications. It also extends available estimates which hold uniformly on the boundary of Ω. In addition, a link is provided with the adjoint method of calculating topological expansions of cost functions.

    "Abstract": "Given a bearing of some specified macroscopic shape, what is the effect of texturing its surfaces uniformly? Experimental and numerical investigations on this question have recently been pursued, which we complement here with a mathematical analysis based on a seemingly novel combination of homogenization techniques and perturbation analysis. The flow is assumed governed by the Reynolds equation, with cavitation effects disregarded, and the texture length is assumed much smaller than the bearing's length. The results, which hold true for small-amplitude periodic textures and in the limit of vanishing period, can be summarized as follows: (a) The texture that maximizes the load for a given minimum clearance is no texture at all (i.e., the untextured shape); and (b) the texture that minimizes the friction coefficient is again the untextured shape.

    "Title": "Homogenization of the transient Reynolds equation",
    "Abstract": "State-of-the-art magnetic storage devices have head-to-disk distances of about 300 Angstrom, for which compressibility, slip-flow and roughness effects are significant. Since the head and the disk are in relative motion, the air-gap thickness when both surfaces are rough varies rapidly in both space and time. A rigorous homogenization of the transient compressible Reynolds equation appropriate for such situation is presented in this article. If ∈ is the roughness length and p∈ the pressure field for that roughness, the existence of p0 ∈ L2 (0, T, H1(Ω)) such that p∈ → p0 strongly in L2(Ω × ]0,T[) when ∈ → 0 is proved. A homogenized problem for p0 is introduced together with a uniqueness result under remarkably weak assumptions, i.e., p0 ∈ L2(0, T, H1(Ω)) and ∂p0/∂t ∈ L2(0, T, H-1(Ω)). Interestingly, no time derivatives appear in the auxiliary local problems, which are thus computed as in the steady state case. The role of the time variable is to parameterize the relative positions of the roughness shapes, and the homogenized coefficients result from averaging all such positions. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous treatment of lubrication problems accounting for roughness on both surfaces.",

    "Title": "New Real Dataset Creation to Develop an Intelligent System for Predicting Chemotherapy Protocols Case of Moroccan Breast Cancer Patients",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women. In developing countries, controlling this scourge is often problematic due to late diagnosis and the lack of medical and human resources. Automation and optimization of treatment is then needed to improve patient outcome. The use of medical datasets could, according to medical staff and pharmacists, assist them in clinical decision-making and would allow for better use of resources especially when limited. In our paper, a new real dataset was produced by collecting medical and personal data from 601 patients with breast cancer at the University Hospital Center (UHC) Mohammed VI of Marrakech. Data of women diagnosed with breast cancer from January 2018 at UHC were assessed. Most patients were 24-85 year-old, with an average age of 48.84 years. Patient age, performance status (PS), cancer stage and subtype, treatment patterns and correlations among the different variables were analyzed. The created dataset will help to determine the most appropriate treatment regimen depending on the individual characteristics of patients to allow for better use of limited resources.",

    "Title": "A modified choice function hyper-heuristic with boltzmann function",
    "Abstract": "Hyper-heuristics are a subclass of high-level research methods that function in a low-level heuristic research space. Their aim objective is to improve the level of generality for solving combinatorial optimization problems using two main components: a methodology for the heuristic selection and a move acceptance criterion, to ensure intensification and diversification [1]. Thus, rather than working directly on the problem’s solutions and selecting one of them to proceed to the next step at each stage, hyper-heuristics operates on a low-level heuristic research space. The choice function is one of the hyper-heuristics that have proven their efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems [2–4]. At each iteration, the selection of heuristics is dependent on a score calculated by combining three different measures to guarantee both intensification and diversification for the heuristics choice process. The heuristic with the highest score is therefore chosen to be applied to the problem. Therefore, the key to the success of the choice function is to choose the correct weight parameters of its three measures. In this study, we make a state of the art in hyper-heuristic research and propose a new method that automatically controls these weight parameters based on the Boltzmann function. The results obtained from its application on five problem domains are compared with those of the standard, modified choice function proposed by Drake et al. [2, 3].",

    "Title": "Sentiment analysis dataset in Moroccan dialect: bridging the gap between Arabic and Latin scripted dialect",
    "Abstract": "Sentiment analysis, the automated process of determining emotions or opinions expressed in text, has seen extensive exploration in the field of natural language processing. However, one aspect that has remained underrepresented is the sentiment analysis of the Moroccan dialect, which boasts a unique linguistic landscape and the coexistence of multiple scripts. Previous works in sentiment analysis primarily targeted dialects employing Arabic script. While these efforts provided valuable insights, they may not fully capture the complexity of Moroccan web content, which features a blend of Arabic and Latin script. As a result, our study emphasizes the importance of extending sentiment analysis to encompass the entire spectrum of Moroccan linguistic diversity. Central to our research is the creation of the largest public dataset for Moroccan dialect sentiment analysis that incorporates not only Moroccan dialect written in Arabic script but also in Latin characters. By assembling a diverse range of textual data, we were able to construct a dataset with a range of 19,991 manually labeled texts in Moroccan dialect and also publicly available lists of stop words in Moroccan dialect as a new contribution to Moroccan Arabic resources. In our exploration of sentiment analysis, we undertook a comprehensive study encompassing various machine-learning models to assess their compatibility with our dataset. While our investigation revealed that the highest accuracy of 98.42% was attained through the utilization of the DarijaBert-mix transfer-learning model, we also delved into deep learning models. Notably, our experimentation yielded a commendable accuracy rate of 92% when employing a CNN model. Furthermore, in an effort to affirm the reliability of our dataset, we tested the CNN model using smaller publicly available datasets of Moroccan dialect, with results that proved to be promising and supportive of our findings.",

In this paper, we propose to use Copulas to model the dependency structure between these signals, enabling the separation of dependent source components; we also deploy α-divergence as our cost function to minimize, considering its superiority to handle noisy data as well as its ability to converge faster. We test our approach for various values of alpha and give a comparative study between the proposed methodology and other existing methods; this approach exhibited a higher quality performance and accuracy, especially when the value of α is equal to 12, which is equivalent to the Hellinger divergence.",

The data used were collected at Mohammed VI Hospital in Morocco, and it contains patient information with two targets (protocol and treatment cycle). After preparing the data and testing several machine learning algorithms, two models were developed: The first one, based on Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithm, successfully classified patient treatment protocols with an overall accuracy of 64 % across all categories and an impressive 94 % accuracy for the mode category, widely adopted in the hospital. The second model, based on Random Forest Regressor algorithm, which integrates the results of the first model during the training, predicted the treatment cycle of patients with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score of 0.050 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) score of 0.020. Furthermore, feature importance analysis was performed to highlight the importance of variables, and show the positive influence of some variables on the models. Finally, this study can help doctors quickly make decisions about the treatment needed for each patient and also gives an idea of which molecules should exist in the hospital stock based on the patient's treatment cycle predicted.",

    "Title": "Multi-phase dynamic constraint aggregation for set partitioning type problems",
    "Abstract": "Dynamic constraint aggregation is an iterative method that was recently introduced to speed up the linear relaxation solution process of set partitioning type problems. This speed up is mostly due to the use, at each iteration, of an aggregated problem defined by aggregating disjoint subsets of constraints from the set partitioning model. This aggregation is updated when needed to ensure the exactness of the overall approach. In this paper, we propose a new version of this method, called the multi-phase dynamic constraint aggregation method, which essentially adds to the original method a partial pricing strategy that involves multiple phases. This strategy helps keeping the size of the aggregated problem as small as possible, yielding a faster average computation time per iteration and fewer iterations. We also establish theoretical results that provide some insights explaining the success of the proposed method. Tests on the linear relaxation of simultaneous bus and driver scheduling problems involving up to 2,000 set partitioning constraints show that the partial pricing strategy speeds up the original method by an average factor of 4.5. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",

    "Title": "An improved primal simplex algorithm for degenerate linear programs",
    "Abstract": "Since its appearance in 1947, the primal simplex algorithm has been one of the most popular algorithms for solving linear programs. It is often very efficient when there is very little degeneracy, but it often struggles in the presence of high degeneracy, executing many pivots without improving the objective function value. In this paper, we propose an improved primal simplex algorithm that deals with this issue. This algorithm is based on new theoretical results that shed light on how to reduce the negative impact of degeneracy. In particular, we show that, from a nonoptimal basic solution with p positive-valued variables, there exists a sequence of at most m.pC1 simplex pivots that guarantee the improvement of the objective value, where m is the number of constraints in the linear program. These pivots can be identified by solving an auxiliary linear program. Finally, we briefly summarize computational results that show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on degenerate linear programs. © 2011 INFORMS.",

This paper introduces a new multi-phase tuner based on the iterated local search meta-heuristic. This tuner addresses the parameter configuration problem for deterministic MILP solvers that are used to solve challenging industrial optimization problems. Further, the proposed tuner offers a new search strategy based on three ideas. First, instead of tuning in the entire configuration space induced by the parameter set, the multi-phase tuner focuses on a small parameter pool that is dynamically enriched with new promising parameters. Second, it leverages the gathered knowledge during the search using statistical learning to forbid less promising parameter combinations. Third, it tunes on a single instance provided by earlier clustering of MILP instances. A computational study on the widely-used commercial solver CPLEX with instances from the MIPLIB library and a real large-scale optimization problem highlights the promising potential of the tuner.",

    "Title": "Dynamic constraint and variable aggregation in column generation",
    "Abstract": "Starting from the improved primal simplex (IPS) decomposition, introduced by Elhallaoui et al. (2011) to tackle degeneracy in general linear programs, we introduce and discuss the mathematical foundations of improved column-generation decompositions (ICG) that are better than the standard column-generation decomposition when degeneracy is an issue. We also present an improved dynamic constraint aggregation (IDCA), which is a specialization of ICG to efficiently solve set partitioning problems. We show that IDCA improves the dynamic constraint aggregation (DCA) and the multiphase dynamic constraint aggregation (MPDCA) algorithms (Elhallaoui et al., 2005, 2010) that not only reduce degeneracy but also profit from it to efficiently solve set partitioning problems. IDCA solves at each iteration a complementary problem (CP) to obtain a group of variables that can be aggregated or pivoted into the basis to bypass degenerate pivots and decrease the objective value and to obtain more “central” dual solutions to generate new columns. Our numerical results show reduction factors in the solution times exceeding 10 for IDCA compared to a state-of-the-art standard column-generation solver.",

    "Abstract": "The framework of this article is to introduce a new efficient Blind Source Separation (BSS) method that handles mixtures of noise-contaminated independent / dependent sources. In order to achieve that, one can minimize a criterion that fuses a separating part, based on Kullback–Leibler divergence to set apart the observed mixtures of either dependent or independent sources, with a regularization part that employs the bilateral total variation (BTV) for the purpose of denoising the observations. The proposed algorithm utilizes a primal-dual algorithm to remove the noise, while a gradient descent method is implemented to retrieve the source signals. Our algorithm has shown its effectiveness and efficiency toward the noisy dependent / independent sources and also surpassed the standard BSS algorithms through different experimental results.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer causes the highest number of deaths weekly. It is the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of death in women in the world. Deep learning and machine learning are a way to predict perfect therapeutic protocols for patients. This paper presents different models to perform the prediction of breast cancer chemotherapy protocol and the number of cycles of cure using deep learning and machine learning algorithms. The database of therapeutic protocols related to 600 patients with breast cancer pathology was constructed at the University Hospital Center of Marrakesh, Morocco, it was treated following three distinct procedures before being used. In the first procedure, even though it is imbalanced, the database was left as it was. In the second procedure, the database was divided into three equal classes of 200 samples (Three balanced classes). As for the third, a database augmentation was realized, so that the minority classes have the same number of samples as the majority classes to have a balanced database. The main objective is to determine with our restricted database that we have collected since 2018, the best algorithm for the prediction of the therapeutic protocol and number of cycles, in accuracy terms, balanced accuracy, time, and precision. The results show that machine learning algorithms, especially Random Forest and XGBoost gave the best scores when the database was amplified.",

    "Title": "Multi-phase dynamic constraint aggregation for set partitioning type problems",
    "Abstract": "Dynamic constraint aggregation is an iterative method that was recently introduced to speed up the linear relaxation solution process of set partitioning type problems. This speed up is mostly due to the use, at each iteration, of an aggregated problem defined by aggregating disjoint subsets of constraints from the set partitioning model. This aggregation is updated when needed to ensure the exactness of the overall approach. In this paper, we propose a new version of this method, called the multi-phase dynamic constraint aggregation method, which essentially adds to the original method a partial pricing strategy that involves multiple phases. This strategy helps keeping the size of the aggregated problem as small as possible, yielding a faster average computation time per iteration and fewer iterations. We also establish theoretical results that provide some insights explaining the success of the proposed …",

    "Title": "An improved primal simplex algorithm for degenerate linear programs",
    "Abstract": "Since its appearance in 1947, the primal simplex algorithm has been one of the most popular algorithms for solving linear programs. It is often very efficient when there is very little degeneracy, but it often struggles in the presence of high degeneracy, executing many pivots without improving the objective function value. In this paper, we propose an improved primal simplex algorithm that deals with this issue. This algorithm is based on new theoretical results that shed light on how to reduce the negative impact of degeneracy. In particular, we show that, from a nonoptimal basic solution with p positive-valued variables, there exists a sequence of at most m - p + 1 simplex pivots that guarantee the improvement of the objective value, where m is the number of constraints in the linear program. These pivots can be identified by solving an auxiliary linear program. Finally, we briefly summarize computational results that …",

Through our analysis, we expect to find the best compromise between the reduced running time and a best good solution, which leads to four distinct combinations of parallel/sequential approaches.

Data of women diagnosed with breast cancer from January 2018 at UHC were assessed. Most patients were 24-85 year-old, with an average age of 48.84 years.

    "Title": "A modified choice function hyper-heuristic with Boltzmann function",
    "Abstract": "Hyper-heuristics are a subclass of high-level research methods that function in a low-level heuristic research space. Their aim objective is to improve the level of generality for solving combinatorial optimization problems using two main components: a methodology for the heuristic selection and a move acceptance criterion, to ensure intensification and diversification [1]. Thus, rather than working directly on the problem’s solutions and selecting one of them to proceed to the next step at each stage, hyper-heuristics operates on a low-level heuristic research space. The choice function is one of the hyper-heuristics that have proven their efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems [2–4]. At each iteration, the selection of heuristics is dependent on a score calculated by combining three different measures to guarantee both intensification and diversification for the heuristics choice process. The heuristic with the highest score is therefore chosen to be applied to the problem. Therefore, the key to the success of the choice function is to choose the correct weight parameters of its three measures. In this study, we make a state of the art in hyper-heuristic research and propose a new method that automatically controls these weight parameters based on the Boltzmann function. The results obtained from its application on five problem domains are compared with those of the standard, modified choice function proposed by Drake et al.[2, 3].",
