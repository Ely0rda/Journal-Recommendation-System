## Overview

The Journal Recommendation System is an AI-powered tool designed to help researchers find the most suitable academic journals for their papers. By analyzing the content of paper abstracts and comparing them against a comprehensive database of journal scopes and published articles, the system provides personalized recommendations that increase the chances of publication acceptance and reach the right academic audience.

## Architecture

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system using both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The system architecture consists of:

- A data ingestion pipeline for journal metadata and abstracts
- NLP preprocessing module for text normalization and feature extraction
- A vector embedding model using TF-IDF and word2vec/BERT
- Similarity calculation engine using cosine similarity


## Key Features

1. **Abstract Analysis** - Extracts key topics, methodology, and research domains from paper abstracts
2. **Personalized Recommendations** - Considers user's publication history and research interests
3. **Journal Impact Metrics** - Incorporates impact factors and domain-specific metrics in recommendations
4. **Interactive Visualization** - Displays journal recommendations with relevance scores and submission requirements
