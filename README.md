## Overview

The Journal Recommendation System is an AI-powered tool designed to help researchers find the most suitable academic journals for their papers. By analyzing the content of paper abstracts and comparing them against a comprehensive database of journal scopes and published articles, the system provides personalized recommendations that increase the chances of publication acceptance and reach the right academic audience.

## Architecture

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system using both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The system architecture consists of:

- A data ingestion pipeline for journal metadata and abstracts
- NLP preprocessing module for text normalization and feature extraction
- A vector embedding model using TF-IDF and word2vec/BERT
- Similarity calculation engine using cosine similarity
- User feedback integration for continuous model improvement
- REST API for frontend integration

## Key Features

1. **Abstract Analysis** - Extracts key topics, methodology, and research domains from paper abstracts
2. **Personalized Recommendations** - Considers user's publication history and research interests
3. **Journal Impact Metrics** - Incorporates impact factors and domain-specific metrics in recommendations
4. **Interactive Visualization** - Displays journal recommendations with relevance scores and submission requirements

## Usage

### Running the Application

```
python app.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5000.

### API Endpoints

```python
# Example: Get recommendations for a paper abstract
import requests
import json

url = 'http://localhost:5000/api/recommendations'
data = {
    'abstract': 'This paper explores the application of deep learning in genomics...',
    'keywords': ['deep learning', 'genomics', 'bioinformatics'],
    'user_id': '12345'  # Optional
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
recommendations = json.loads(response.text)
print(recommendations)
```

### Training the Model

```
python scripts/train_model.py --data_path data/journals --epochs 20
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/test_embedding_models.py
```

The CI pipeline automatically runs tests on every pull request and push to the main branch.

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

```
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t journal-rec-system .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017 journal-rec-system
```

### Cloud Deployment

The application can be deployed to AWS, GCP, or Azure using the provided infrastructure-as-code templates:

```
# Example for AWS deployment
cd deployment
terraform init
terraform apply -var="region=us-west-2"
```
